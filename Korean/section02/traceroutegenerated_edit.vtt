Hellooo! Welcome back.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.630
We mentioned in the last lesson that we're going
to be talking about traceroute. What is that?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.469
Well I just wanted to finally, get the entire
picture of the Internet across and I think this

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.090
is the best way to do it.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.879
Now if you're on a Mac you're going to press CMD
Space and look for a program that comes with your

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.730
Mac called terminal and you're going to
press Enter and you're going to get this.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.520
So it's an application that all Macs have.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.810
If you're on a Windows machine it's called Command
Prompt and in the exercise right after this lesson

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.700
I will show you instructions
on how to access that as well.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:46.609
We're going to talk about traceroute, and if you remember
we spoke about this image of all these connected

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.510
things happening and going to the Internet backbone
and then Google.com finally sends us the files

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.239
back to our house and you can actually monitor how
that's going to work on here using traceroute.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.670
So if we type in traceroute and on
Windows machine, it's actually 'tracert'.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.569
But for now we'll just go traceroute and you
can request for whatever website you want.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.060
So let's go with Google.com.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.440
I press Enter and yep, look at that.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.930
It gave me a whole bunch
of hops that it did.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.540
So you can see 1 through 9 here so did 9
hopps, so that means 9 stops to this address

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.249
at 172.217.1.14

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.859
So again, that looks like the IP address.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.579
So again let's always
test our experiments here.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.320
If I put that in and press Enter, we should get
Google.com. let's see. Look at that; google.com!

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.510
So that's a fun little way of you
to see where your requests go.

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.380
And you can monitor, you can see all these IP addresses
are different computers, that are trying to locate

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.000
the Google servers.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.170
So go ahead in the next section there's a little
exercise you can play around with this and

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.210
just see where all your
requests go all over the world.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.550
I think it's very very cool.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.439
We're going to finish up in the next section with some
fundamentals and what we can do with this knowledge

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.300
that we have, to actually become
really good web developers.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.220
So see in the next section. Bye-bye.
