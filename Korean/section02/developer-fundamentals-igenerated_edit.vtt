00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.590
Welcome back!

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.389
Good job! You've made it this far and
you're probably asking yourself, "Andrei,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.290
this has been really
good really informative.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.039
But where is the coding; I want
to start building some websites."

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.469
And I know,
I know we'll get there don't worry.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:20.249
But without even realizing it you just learned some
really really important fundamental skills, and something

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.380
that will take you very very far in the career of a
web developer because now you know how to improve

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.870
website performance without
a single line of code.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.839
And just so you know we're
gonna get a little silly here.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.059
We're actually going to make sure that you remember
these fundamental skills every time throughout these

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.500
lessons there's going to be chunks of very important
lessons and to symbolize how important they are.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.739
I'm going to get Jean-Claude
Van Damme's help.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.989
So again this is an important lesson.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.380
This is an important fundamental,
web developer concept.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.790
So Jean-Claude Van Damme,
how important is it?

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.520
All right.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.939
So as you can see a very
important concept and what is it?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.969
Well like I said without writing a single line of code
you now know how to improve a website's performance

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.580
so let's think about this.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.269
There's three things.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.629
We send 'google.com', we talk to Google servers, and
we get these files back. So just looking at this and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.450
looking at what you've learned so far what's one thing
that would make sure that this this process would be fast?

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.870
Let's look at the first one I'm
going to give you a second to think.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.489
Hopefully you get it.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.040
The first one is location of the server.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.690
We saw how big the Internet backbone is.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.389
So if the servers are really really close to you,
let's say you're in the States and the servers are

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.199
just a couple of kilometers away that hop is going
to be really really fast versus if it's all the way

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.130
across the globe.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.640
So location of the server is important.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.809
And we'll talk about these and how big companies
use these to their advantage later on.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.410
So that makes sense.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.860
Let's look at the next one.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.470
So the next one is how many trips.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:11.369
So hopefully, ideally we just have one trip to the
Google servers and Google servers send us all the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.669
files that we need back.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.209
But as we know there's new pages there are searches
so this communication with Google is back and forth,

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.980
back and forth.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.680
And the less trips we have, the faster
that we would be able to to get the files.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.469
So how many trips. And then finally size of files
again if this HTML file, CSS file, or Javascript

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.780
file is massive and it's
you know 100 megabytes.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.039
Well that's going to be a lot slower to transfer over
the Internet than it is, if it was just a couple

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.870
of kilobytes.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.750
So there it is.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.869
These three things are something that you'll take
with you and you'll realize that every time you're

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.449
building an application or web site you're going to
be thinking about these things and these are going

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.900
to help you make sure that you have a performant,
fast web site and we're going to take these with us

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.220
as we go on throughout the course.
Talk to you soon.
