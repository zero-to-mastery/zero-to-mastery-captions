WEBVTT

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.440
Hellooooo!

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.950
That was a little bit excessive but I'm
very very excited to start the course.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.959
So in this section we're going to be talking about
browsing the web it's the first part in the How

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.560
the Internet Works section,
and some of you are thinking right now.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa Andrei,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.770
come on.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.159
I know how the Internet works.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.780
Let's get to the

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:23.420
heavy, you know, technical stuff.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.459
But this is something that actually
took me quite a few years to learn.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.419
And I see a lot of people just skimming the surface of
this stuff without fully understanding how everything

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.059
works together, without having those foundations it's
actually very, very difficult to think about performance,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.659
optimizing your sites and so on and so on.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.809
So we're going to start off very, very
basic and we're going to learn something

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.840
that took me many years to to learn and once I figured
this out everything clicked so just hang in there

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.836
trust me, I promise you you'll learn something new
in this section and we're going to be talking about

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.160
browsing the web.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.910
We have over here a laptop and we have our browser
let's say Google Chrome and we typically like

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.419
to say, go to Google and we're going to
visit Google so we type in Google.com

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.190
Well what happens
technically when we do that?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.900
When we enter Google.com we
press enter on our keyboard.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.409
We ask a question who's
this Google.com fellow?

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.470
And that question gets asked
all the way down to our ISP.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.899
ISP is Internet Service Provider and I put a
dollar sign up here just so you know those are

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.769
the people that you pay so
you can have Internet.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.949
So if you're in the states
that's Cogiko, Verizon.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.289
If you're in Canada that'll be Bell or Rogers or you
know, depending on your country you have your big big

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.710
companies that make a lot of money from Internet usage.
So they get that request and they send that off

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.390
to something called the DNS server so Domain Name
Servers and we'll get into that later on in the course.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.520
So don't worry too much about it.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.280
But essentially it's a phone book - a phone
book that has the list of all these URLs

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.150
like Google.com and it has the addresses
of them, so exactly like a phone book.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.890
They know where Google.com is so they say,
"Hey you know, I don't know Mr. Google.com

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.990
personally, but I do know his address.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.470
So you should go check him out."

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.909
So they send off that request back through the ISP
and the website or the web browser, Google Chrome

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:32.040
in this case gets "172.217.7.23" alright,
cool, but nothing is showing up yet.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.370
There's no there's no Google.com,
I can't do any searches yet.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.980
OK we receive - it's what
we call an IP address.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.560
So think of this as something that every single computer
has one, anything that's connected to the Internet

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.289
has its own address so the laptop that I'm working
on right now an IP address, your laptop or computer

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.440
has an IP address.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.479
So this IP address allows the Internet to work
essentially, it knows our location our address.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.370
So what we do now with Google.com we know this IP
address - the browser sends off another request

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.180
to the Google servers and it knows where the Google
servers are because, well because we have this address

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.810
so we go seek it out and you can think
of servers as computers essentially.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.690
My laptop could be a server
your computer could be a server.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.930
Servers are essentially computers that are
sometimes in basements or in huge server farms

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.620
and they have a piece of software running that just
like at a restaurant where a server brings you food.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.439
It knows how to send you files
when you request for them.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.409
So we send this off and the Google
servers say oh yeah no problem,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.719
let me give you my HTML CSS and Javascript
and we'll get into what those are

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.179
later on in the course, but think of them as just text
files. They are text files that Google is going to send

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.400
to the browser so we
can have Google working.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.509
So let me just minimize this
and show you what it's doing.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.160
So we're copying these files and Google server's
saying yeah no problem thanks for asking for Google.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.170
Here it is.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.580
And the web browser receives the HTML, CSS,

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.109
and javascript.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:26.670
So if we go to the next section boom we
have google.com and everything's working.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.580
Now that sounded like a whole bunch of stuff that
happened in between and when we're on the internet

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.639
everything is quite fast but yet underneath the hood
all of that is happening and it's crazy to think

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:42.759
how fast everything works.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.900
Don't take my word for it.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.910
Let's just check this process that
I'm not just making stuff up for you.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.009
If what we learned was correct,
technically we can skip this process right.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:04.599
I mean if we know the address of Google can we just,
you know, go into this directly and just instead

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.749
of putting Google.com, just put in this in our search
bar and it automatically goes to the Google servers.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.310
Well let's try it out.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.699
Let's let's open up Google here.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.360
And ooh, what a pretty picture.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.730
All right.

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:25.489
So we go to Google.com, nothing crazy here and
that's great but, what if instead of that I put in

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.030
the IP address so 172, there's no way I could
remember this address, so I've done this before

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.239
and I press Enter look at that, Google.com.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.100
So as you can see, I'm not lying.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.999
It's what's happening. The IP address gets sent to
the Google servers - Google servers sends us a few

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.029
files so that we can finally load Google.com. In
the next section we're going to do something fun.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:56.735
We're going to break a bit of Google and - and toy
around with the webite again to show you how cool

00:05:56.736 --> 00:05:58.270
all of this technology is.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.900
See you in the next one! Bye-Bye!
