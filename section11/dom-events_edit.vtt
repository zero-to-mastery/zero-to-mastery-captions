WEBVTT

00:01.490 --> 00:02.700
Welcome back.

00:02.840 --> 00:05.050
This is the part that gets really exciting.

00:05.360 --> 00:11.230
You can use JavaScript to listen to events and that based on what the user does.

00:11.240 --> 00:19.900
Now what do I mean by events? Events are things like clicking, mouse entering or hovering over something

00:20.470 --> 00:24.170
or user trying something in a search bar.

00:25.560 --> 00:31.310
So we can listen to these events and react to them using JavaScript.

00:31.320 --> 00:36.100
Let me show you how. We have are all shopping lists from the previous video.

00:36.510 --> 00:39.310
And if I add a button here.

00:42.060 --> 00:47.530
And we'll just say Click Me, save and refresh.

00:47.590 --> 00:50.800
We have the Click Me button.

00:50.830 --> 00:57.340
I've also created a script dot JS file here in the same folder as index HTML and we obviously

00:57.340 --> 00:58.130
want to add it.

00:58.180 --> 01:08.070
So we'll do it right at the bottom as we've mentioned in previous videos and we can include it by referencing

01:08.070 --> 01:16.070
it through the source and we'll call it Script thought just to reference the name on the script.

01:16.110 --> 01:19.420
Let's save now learning what we've learned.

01:19.430 --> 01:22.460
We can select this quick button.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.830
Let's test this out if we want to select the button.

01:25.850 --> 01:38.600
I can say document dot get element by tag name and we'll say button so that selects the button for us.

01:38.620 --> 01:43.580
OK so how can we listen to the fact that a user can click this button.

01:45.900 --> 01:51.770
What we have something called events and what these are and are all linked.

01:51.780 --> 01:59.550
The reference here is there are a whole bunch of events that a Web browser allows us to listen to.

01:59.550 --> 02:06.360
So if you look over here we have mouse events like mouse moved mouse over a click double click.

02:06.360 --> 02:10.400
We have key press and a whole bunch of other events.

02:10.740 --> 02:16.710
But the most common ones and the one thing you'll see 90 percent of the time are mouse events and keyboard

02:16.710 --> 02:17.750
events.

02:17.790 --> 02:23.450
So if we look over here we have a click so we can listen for click.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.500
How can we do that.

02:25.530 --> 02:36.360
Well in my script Paul I'm going to say document or let's call it button equals document dot get aliments

02:36.600 --> 02:44.240
by Diagne and it will select the button.

02:44.440 --> 02:54.690
Now that we have the reference to the button I can now say button Daut had the event listener and this

02:54.690 --> 03:01.380
is a method that we can use and it accepts two parameters.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.910
The first one is the event.

03:03.980 --> 03:12.040
In our case we're listening to the click event and the second parameter is the function or what we want

03:12.040 --> 03:14.440
to do based on the click.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.270
So in our case we can just say

03:19.030 --> 03:24.700
console dot log click.

03:24.790 --> 03:32.890
So we're saying had an event listener to this button that we've selected whenever the user clicks I

03:32.890 --> 03:39.370
want to run this function and this function is to console log click.

03:39.460 --> 03:40.560
Let's see if that works.

03:40.720 --> 03:41.600
And refresh.

03:41.620 --> 03:49.770
And we see that we have button add event listener is not a function and that is because remember Get

03:49.830 --> 03:55.830
elements by tag name returns an array of buttons.

03:55.830 --> 04:07.870
So if we copy and paste this we see that in order to access the button we have to go 0 to access the

04:07.870 --> 04:09.060
first element in the array.

04:09.060 --> 04:12.670
So that's a very common mistake that people make.

04:12.670 --> 04:19.130
So make sure that if you get this error that's probably because you're trying to use a method on an

04:19.130 --> 04:24.300
array and you need to use that method on the actual element OK.

04:24.430 --> 04:27.550
Let me close that and fix this to say

04:30.830 --> 04:39.170
the first born perfect I'm going to save that a little bit smaller so you can see and refresh and I

04:39.170 --> 04:46.820
can open up the console and see what happens when I click click click click click click OK.

04:46.880 --> 04:47.620
So it's working.

04:47.620 --> 05:00.410
We're listening to the click event very very cool I can also listen to something like my center and

05:00.800 --> 05:04.180
other ear over here and refresh.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.680
You can see over here that as soon as I do most enter

05:09.590 --> 05:10.960
it registers the event.

05:11.210 --> 05:22.290
You can also do mouse leave refresh and every time I leave I get that event.

05:22.460 --> 05:23.270
Very cool.

05:23.450 --> 05:26.500
So there's a ton of them are all linked to this.

05:26.510 --> 05:28.000
So you can check it out yourself.

05:28.010 --> 05:33.280
But like I said keyboard events and mouse events is what you would like to look at.

05:33.560 --> 05:38.990
So looking at this list I think we can improve it.

05:39.020 --> 05:47.480
I think we should have an input and a button where we can type in something and add to the shopping

05:47.480 --> 05:49.410
list.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.000
So I'll try and do that.

05:51.360 --> 05:56.380
And going to erase this code and I'm want to save and refresh.

05:56.920 --> 06:04.390
And we're also going to change a few things here instead of click me the button we want to say Panter

06:05.320 --> 06:16.280
and we'll get this one class of Cantor and we also need an implicit I'm going to remove this p tag and

06:16.280 --> 06:23.790
instead of the no excuses how I'm going to say and put type text.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.070
You remember that's the default.

06:26.120 --> 06:33.480
And we can also add an attribute placeholder enter items.

06:33.500 --> 06:41.130
So now if I save and refresh about I have a placeholder and I can type in whatever I want for right

06:41.130 --> 06:41.910
now.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.900
They don't really do anything.

06:43.940 --> 06:50.240
Ideally when we click enter it gets added to the bottom of the list.

06:50.430 --> 06:51.440
So how can we do that.

06:52.390 --> 06:55.410
First we're going to need to select these items.

06:55.540 --> 07:02.110
So the one thing I really like doing is making sure that we have good class names or Ids for these elements

07:02.110 --> 07:04.690
so that we can grab them easily.

07:04.720 --> 07:14.050
So we definitely want to grab the button which has a class over enter but I actually like using Id because

07:14.060 --> 07:18.810
it'll be really really fast for the Web browser to grab an Id because there's only one of them.

07:18.970 --> 07:22.320
Performance wise although it's very very minuscule

07:22.450 --> 07:23.200
it does help.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.880
So I'm going to change the Id of enter.

07:26.150 --> 07:32.990
And we also want to grab the user input so we can give it an Id of user input.

07:34.120 --> 07:42.400
Now let's open up our script dot JS file and think about the few things that we want to select.

07:42.510 --> 07:52.750
We want to select the input and the button so we can do that by signing them to variable document dot

07:52.990 --> 07:59.620
getElementById.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.070
And here we can just say Antar.

08:02.070 --> 08:08.910
Remember we signed that ID and input will be document.

08:08.940 --> 08:21.040
Get help and by id and we'll do user input here and we want to add an event listener to the button.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.680
So let's do that.

08:22.840 --> 08:35.260
I'm going to say button Dot had event listener We want to listen to the click event and we want to perform

08:35.290 --> 08:38.780
the action the function for now.

08:38.860 --> 08:45.100
Before we get into the actual code it's always good to test what we've written so far so we're just

08:45.100 --> 08:50.760
going to do console log click is working.

08:51.010 --> 08:56.970
Let's save open up the console and refresh.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.320
And if I click click is working right.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.380
Everything's looking good so far.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.880
Ideally we can enter something here.

09:05.050 --> 09:08.860
And when I click enter it gets added to the bottom of the list.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.970
How can we do that let's think about this.

09:13.070 --> 09:22.420
The first thing we want to do is we need to create another alignment so whatever we enter should be

09:22.420 --> 09:30.690
added to the bottom of candle's can use something called a create element method.

09:32.030 --> 09:43.910
So we can do variable ally equals document Daut create element again another method that document gives

09:43.910 --> 09:47.390
us an end here we just tell which element we want to create.

09:47.440 --> 09:53.980
In our case will be a list an ally can now this lie.

09:53.990 --> 09:56.730
We've just created that lives in this very Bowl.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.620
We want to attach it to the bottom of the list.

10:00.630 --> 10:06.850
Again the document object gives us something called append child.

10:06.890 --> 10:17.960
So if I do a lie that append child now in here in order to append to child if we remember our whole

10:17.960 --> 10:26.170
diagram of the dorm we see that each element has a text will be called node.

10:26.480 --> 10:32.310
So we need to add a text note let's do that here.

10:32.410 --> 10:43.630
We'll have to do something called document create text node and then here we can just say testing.

10:43.650 --> 10:50.850
So now we've attached testing to the ally that we've just created.

10:50.850 --> 11:02.360
Again going back to our diagram I've created an ally element and I've added the text of test.

11:02.510 --> 11:09.420
So the last thing we need to do is to attach this to the unordered list.

11:09.430 --> 11:20.950
Right now what we've done is we've created an ally that says testing.

11:21.160 --> 11:26.790
But this is actually not attached to anything it just lives in our program.

11:26.800 --> 11:30.920
But we need to attach it to the unordered list.

11:31.730 --> 11:38.410
And the way we do that is well we grab the unordered list and then append to it.

11:38.420 --> 11:50.250
So again we're going to select one urged list document dot query selector

11:53.290 --> 11:56.030
and we'll select to you all.

11:56.230 --> 11:57.970
And now we can say

12:00.950 --> 12:02.550
I want to append

12:05.440 --> 12:12.570
so append a child to you Well that is lie when we just create it.

12:13.470 --> 12:14.540
So let's see that in action.

12:14.540 --> 12:17.000
I'm going to save and refresh.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.540
I'm going to close the console.

12:18.580 --> 12:23.440
I'm going to press enter that.

12:23.630 --> 12:24.650
It's working.

12:25.100 --> 12:26.500
Let me refresh it again.

12:27.950 --> 12:28.850
There you go.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.520
So this is working and we've learned a few new things here.

12:33.330 --> 12:36.750
One is that we can create an element.

12:36.750 --> 12:43.070
So we just give it the tag that we want to create but this element needs to.

12:43.110 --> 12:47.880
Well if you want to display something it needs to have some sort of a text inside it.

12:47.970 --> 12:50.440
So that is this.

12:50.490 --> 12:57.200
Over here and the way that the document object model works is that in order to create a text you do

12:57.380 --> 13:02.140
create text note and put whatever you want inside of it.

13:02.630 --> 13:08.690
Now we've created the supply but we need to attach it to something that is part of the actual view right

13:08.690 --> 13:09.470
now.

13:09.470 --> 13:19.620
In our case we want to attach it to the unordered list and use apan child which adds it as a child these

13:19.620 --> 13:22.210
three are quite useful.

13:22.420 --> 13:24.640
So you'll just have to practice them and remember them.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.350
But we have something working here which is good.

13:29.340 --> 13:36.980
But ideally we can put something that we enter in here and not just a static testing.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.520
So how can we do that.

13:38.800 --> 13:48.800
We have the input already grabbed and the way we get the value from an input is input.

13:50.180 --> 13:58.700
Daut we don't need the brackets anymore it's input dot thali and we can just test it out over here.

13:58.720 --> 13:59.710
Konsole dialogue

14:07.500 --> 14:08.430
got to refresh.

14:08.460 --> 14:17.260
If I click enter I get hello and it should also be attached to the bottom over here.

14:21.230 --> 14:21.640
OK.

14:22.120 --> 14:27.790
So we have a basic to do list we can enter stuff and quick answer.

14:27.910 --> 14:35.750
But what happens if it's empty and I click enter at DC that just keeps adding stuff on.

14:35.850 --> 14:44.520
Ideally we can skip that if the input is empty well enter shouldn't do anything the way we do that.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.820
Well it sounds like a conditional statement might be useful here.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.000
We can do if input value is.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.440
Well what can we do here to test.

14:54.790 --> 15:02.680
If you remember we have full length property on strings the length property tells us how many characters

15:02.740 --> 15:08.500
a string has.

15:08.540 --> 15:16.520
So we can do something along those lines to say if you put a value to all that is greater than zero.

15:17.590 --> 15:26.860
Then we will move this in here.

15:27.070 --> 15:28.090
Otherwise well.

15:28.230 --> 15:31.640
Otherwise we don't really need to do anything.

15:31.730 --> 15:36.600
We'll just let that click event happen without any actions.

15:36.720 --> 15:44.700
OK so let's see that in action you can save and refresh and I'll do nothing and press ENTER nothing

15:45.150 --> 15:46.650
press enter.

15:47.070 --> 15:51.720
But if I type something it adds it to the list.

15:51.800 --> 15:57.290
But here's another problem I can just keep adding these forever.

15:57.300 --> 16:01.340
Ideally after I enter something it all clears up.

16:01.390 --> 16:09.840
So let me refresh and here what can we do at the end of all of this where we can say and put it toward

16:09.840 --> 16:14.080
value equals an empty string.

16:16.050 --> 16:23.790
After we create the new ally and added to the unordered list I want the input value to now be completely

16:23.790 --> 16:25.160
empty an empty string.

16:25.950 --> 16:28.120
Let's save and refresh.

16:28.330 --> 16:34.620
Let's try that hello quick enter and look at that.

16:34.650 --> 16:39.570
Now I have to type something new again.

16:41.590 --> 16:46.680
All right things are starting to look nicer but it's kind of annoying that I have to keep clicking.

16:46.790 --> 16:52.230
It would be nice to just also be able to press Enter right again if we look at the events.

16:52.230 --> 16:55.770
We also have keyboard events and key press.

16:55.770 --> 17:00.100
Well as the name suggests listens to some sort of a keypress.

17:00.280 --> 17:05.900
And luckily for us we can just listen for the enter key or the return key.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.580
Now how do we do that.

17:09.840 --> 17:10.970
Let's give it a try first.

17:11.020 --> 17:20.090
Well just copy and paste this and this time on the input I'm going to say instead of the Click event

17:20.150 --> 17:22.210
I'm going to say key press.

17:22.220 --> 17:27.950
So we're listening for the key press event and we want to do the exact same thing that we've been doing

17:28.420 --> 17:29.930
so that works.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.890
So how do we know when the enter key is suppressed.

17:34.000 --> 17:42.260
Will we have something called character codes and that is we can listen to which key was typed and each

17:42.260 --> 17:45.260
one is associated with a code with that number.

17:45.290 --> 17:51.620
So this Web site again which are linked to I can just press for a key here and I'll tell me exactly

17:51.980 --> 17:57.010
what code it has so if I press enter I get key code 13.

17:57.170 --> 18:03.920
So we're listening for a key code 13 but again how do we access that.

18:03.980 --> 18:06.130
Open up the console here.

18:06.170 --> 18:14.530
I'll show you that the way we do it is that we listen to something called event dot which And I'm going

18:14.530 --> 18:15.610
to console log this

18:19.090 --> 18:26.890
now and here I'm going to comment the software an so you can see every time an event listeners added.

18:26.890 --> 18:32.540
We have the key press and this function also receives a parameter automatically.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.300
That is the event.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.700
So we can call it we can call it event.

18:37.720 --> 18:49.500
In my case I'll call it event and now when the user presses a key it gives this function an event of

18:49.500 --> 18:54.720
the description of that event that happened actually Leisure's console log the event and see what it

18:54.720 --> 18:55.070
is.

18:55.110 --> 19:05.970
I'm going to refresh and say keep keypress and see that I have the keyboard event and here I get a whole

19:05.970 --> 19:11.240
bunch of information about the event that I just did even get the time when I pressed the key.

19:11.340 --> 19:18.760
But the thing that's really important here is we see that there's key code and there's also which both

19:18.760 --> 19:33.900
of them 107 if my press Enter we see that the key code is 13 which is 13.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.090
Let's give it a go.

19:36.330 --> 19:52.580
I'm going to say now that if input value is greater than zero and event the dot key code equals 13 then

19:53.150 --> 19:55.230
add the item to the list.

19:55.460 --> 19:57.790
Let's save and refresh give that a go.

19:58.070 --> 20:05.970
I'm going to say shopping lists will need pants or Precentor like that.

20:07.280 --> 20:10.900
And that's to Jojo adds it to the list

20:13.660 --> 20:21.530
everything looks good but there's one issue that I'm having here and that is we have a lot of repeat

20:21.580 --> 20:22.900
code.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.780
This seems really unnecessary.

20:24.790 --> 20:31.630
And as I said before one of the principles with being a developer is dry which stands for do not repeat

20:31.630 --> 20:33.100
yourself.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.320
This is not very extensive or is it.

20:35.320 --> 20:40.810
It looks like we're just copy and pasting code and imagine if we had a bunch of events this will just

20:40.810 --> 20:42.220
be a massive file.

20:42.340 --> 20:48.130
So let's extract some of the logic out and show you how we can do something called refactoring which

20:48.130 --> 20:50.620
is making code look a little bit better.

20:50.620 --> 20:57.910
One thing we can do is that it looks like in our IF and we're doing the same thing which is checking

20:57.910 --> 21:01.570
that the input value length is greater than zero.

21:02.020 --> 21:12.480
So if we can add a function here called and put full length and as the name suggests this checks for

21:13.570 --> 21:21.420
and put that value up length but remember as a function we need to return something otherwise.

21:21.480 --> 21:26.920
Well we're going to run this function and it's going to say undefined and undefined cannot well undefined

21:26.920 --> 21:27.750
to greater than zero.

21:27.750 --> 21:29.250
That doesn't make sense.

21:29.280 --> 21:33.880
So return the lenth.

21:33.900 --> 21:43.080
So now again we've extracted that out so we can just say and put lenth run that function whatever of

21:43.080 --> 21:47.930
returns is greater than zero and we'll do the same over here as well.

21:51.310 --> 21:58.090
Now that is a minor change but now we have something that we can use everywhere anytime we create a

21:58.090 --> 21:59.470
new event listener.

21:59.470 --> 22:00.940
What else can we clean up.

22:00.940 --> 22:06.130
It looks like this whole block of code is being repeated here.

22:07.090 --> 22:20.550
So again we can call a function create list element here we can just remove this code added here

22:24.060 --> 22:26.130
and now we can just say

22:30.660 --> 22:39.410
create this element and again remove this and say create this settlement

22:42.230 --> 22:45.640
let's just save and see how everything works right now.

22:45.760 --> 22:54.660
Want to refresh make sure the console doesn't give me any errors and I'm going to say Shell's and if

22:54.660 --> 22:55.470
I press enter

22:58.090 --> 22:59.320
everything still works.

22:59.320 --> 23:04.040
And in case everything's empty I can't add anything.

23:04.040 --> 23:04.590
All right.

23:04.590 --> 23:06.450
The code is looking nice.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.070
It reads pretty well.

23:09.920 --> 23:18.430
The last thing maybe I want to do is instead of having the function here I can extract that out as well.

23:18.460 --> 23:23.830
I can say function add list after

23:28.910 --> 23:36.800
and we can just say Copy this function out and pat it into your and we don't need this function anymore.

23:40.730 --> 23:53.570
And now we can just say add the list after click and we can also have a function pad list after key

23:53.590 --> 23:55.570
press.

23:55.650 --> 23:58.650
And here's the tricky part.

23:58.700 --> 24:05.430
Now we have to copy this.

24:05.610 --> 24:12.290
But before I leave this function you see that we need to receive an event with this.

24:12.480 --> 24:17.960
So it has to receive a parameter because we need that information from the event.

24:17.970 --> 24:28.140
So again when we pass that event remove this function and we have event Tukey code.

24:28.240 --> 24:31.760
Let's see if everything works as expected.

24:32.920 --> 24:36.730
I'm going to save refresh.

24:36.910 --> 24:42.300
See if there's any errors in the console and press water.

24:42.790 --> 24:47.330
That's water juice has juice.

24:47.500 --> 24:52.080
And if I don't press anything or don't try anything it still works.

24:52.120 --> 24:56.210
Let's look at this code one more time and see what's happening.

24:56.230 --> 25:05.220
We started off with selecting the elements that we're interested in and notice here that we're not constantly

25:05.230 --> 25:08.800
every time we need them saying document get Al Lombardi.

25:09.100 --> 25:10.790
We're cashing this.

25:10.810 --> 25:14.830
So at the beginning when the script runs we're saying hey remember this.

25:14.830 --> 25:17.520
I'm going to use it and store it in bond.

25:17.800 --> 25:18.950
And same with Bud.

25:18.970 --> 25:20.640
Same with the unordered list.

25:22.030 --> 25:28.840
We then have a bunch of function declarations but these are never run because they're just saying hey

25:29.080 --> 25:32.530
we have this function but nobody has run them yet.

25:32.720 --> 25:39.340
And the program goes to the bottom and says hey I don't have an listener for klick if anybody ever clicks

25:39.670 --> 25:42.250
on the button run this function.

25:42.590 --> 25:49.200
And if anybody ever has the key press on the input call this function.

25:49.330 --> 25:56.290
And now every time I click this gets triggered and it goes over here says hey has ample length greater

25:56.290 --> 25:59.050
than zero if it is.

25:59.050 --> 26:01.740
Create a list element.

26:01.990 --> 26:03.400
And here it is.

26:03.400 --> 26:10.500
And if I ever have a key press it checks to see if it's the input is greater than zero.

26:10.750 --> 26:19.600
Then I check to see if I press the enter key and then I create a list element and this looks pretty

26:19.630 --> 26:20.470
clean right.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.820
Anybody can come in if they know a little bit of JavaScript.

26:23.830 --> 26:29.350
You can read what is happening just from the code and that is something you really want to strive for

26:29.350 --> 26:32.200
where you don't want to repeat yourself.

26:32.200 --> 26:40.490
You want to cache these queries so that we're not using up too much power for the browser.

26:41.550 --> 26:49.450
And we have everything broken down into functions that are very very simple OK.

26:49.690 --> 26:50.990
That's it for now.

26:51.010 --> 26:57.340
Add any shopping list items you need and I'll see you in the next video. Bye Bye.
