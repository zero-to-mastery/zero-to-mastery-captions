00:01.660 --> 00:02.500
Welcome back!

00:02.500 --> 00:06.830
I wanted to show you something that we haven't really talked about.

00:07.030 --> 00:15.300
But again, it's important to know and that is that JavaScript has its own language to start off with.

00:15.580 --> 00:19.400
And these are called 'keywords' and you can see here

00:19.420 --> 00:27.730
these are all JavaScript 'keywords' and what they mean is that when I changed this from 'Markdown' to 'JavaScript',

00:28.000 --> 00:36.430
well, all of these, you can see have changed colors and that is because all these words are cues within JavaScript

00:36.430 --> 00:40.400
that if you use them, it already has a predefined meaning attached to it.

00:41.690 --> 00:44.630
So, for example, if we open up the browser

00:48.820 --> 01:00.360
and I do 'var for = 7', I'll get a 'SyntaxError' because, well 'for' is used for 'for loop'.

01:00.440 --> 01:01.240
I can't do

01:01.280 --> 01:02.760
'var' equals 'var'

01:02.970 --> 01:08.690
'= 8' because, well, 'var' already means something in JavaScript.

01:08.690 --> 01:15.140
So, JavaScript 'keywords' are words that you cannot use, because it'll have unintended consequences.

01:15.140 --> 01:20.840
JavaScript is going to read it and say 'Oh, you're trying to mean something that I already know the meaning

01:20.840 --> 01:22.090
of'.

01:22.110 --> 01:24.520
So, this list over here.

01:24.720 --> 01:30.090
You just have to be cautious that you don't name your variables or your functions this way.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.300
But as you can see, these are the words that we've been using up until this point to create functions, to create

01:36.300 --> 01:41.200
'for' loops and we'll encounter these throughout the course.

01:41.460 --> 01:47.310
But I wanted to leave this for you in the next section, so that you'll have it as a reference.

01:47.310 --> 01:52.920
I also want to show you what we've learned so far and I'm going to change this back to 'Markdown' so

01:53.370 --> 01:55.510
it's a little bit cleaner.

01:55.950 --> 01:59.440
Look at all the stuff we've done. We've done 'looping'.

01:59.550 --> 02:07.290
We've learned about 'data structures', we've learned about 'functions', 'logical operators', 'conditionals', 'variables',

02:07.620 --> 02:14.520
'comparisons' and 'types', and there's still a few things that are grayed out here, but we've learned 80%

02:14.520 --> 02:17.580
of what's really-really important in JavaScript.

02:17.580 --> 02:23.790
These other the ones that we'll get to in the advanced section, but what we've learned up until now is

02:23.790 --> 02:26.490
something, that all computer programs have.

02:26.490 --> 02:33.180
Once you learn this, if you wanted to learn a new language, there are small minor differences, but they

02:33.180 --> 02:34.510
all have 'types'.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.090
They all have 'conditionals'.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.400
They all have 'loops'.

02:37.530 --> 02:44.510
So once you master one programming language, you can move on to others a lot faster than your first one.

02:45.750 --> 02:53.070
So use that as motivation to go through all these things, that we've learned, because in the next few sessions

02:53.310 --> 02:55.240
we're going to learn even more.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.880
We've got a lot covered.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.730
I'm really proud of you making it this far.

02:59.730 --> 03:01.990
Can't wait to see you on the next video.
