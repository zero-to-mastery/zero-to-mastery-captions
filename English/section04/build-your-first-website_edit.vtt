00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.780
Hello and welcome back to
a very exciting section.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.680
Why is it exciting?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.370
Well, we finally get to code, and we're going to start
off by learning HTML, and then finally building

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.140
our very first website.
In order for us to get started,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.919
we need to set up our
environment, and we do that by -

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.070
let's open up Google Chrome and we're
going to search for 'Sublime Text 3'.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.140
This is a text editor that
a lot of developers use.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.270
I myself have used it for years.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.650
I absolutely love it.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.530
In your day to day job you'll
use something like this.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.500
I highly recommend Sublime Text.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.310
If you have a Mac version over here if you have a PC
running Windows, you'll have the download link for

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.290
Windows.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:56.339
So for me I'm going to download for the Mac and you
can see here it's downloaded and I can drag it to

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.909
my applications folder if I want and you can double click.
And if this is your first time downloading Sublime

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.860
Text, you get something like this
to give it permission to load.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.040
And there you go, we have Sublime Text.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.990
Now what is a text editor? A text editor is a program that allows us to write code.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.300
You can see over here on the right hand side of Sublime Text that it just says 'Plain Text' so I can

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.910
type anything that I want and there's nothing much different than if you wrote this in Word or a text

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.160
file. But the part with a text editor, especially with something like Sublime, that's geared towards coding.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.800
If you click on 'Plain Text' here, you'll have a whole bunch of options of what type of code you're writing.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.550
So in our case we're doing HTML,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.970
so if I click on 'HTML', nothing changes except for the bottom part over here.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.580
But now if I type something, well everything looks the same, but if I start typing HTML, It'll

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.530
actually recognize it and help with syntax.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.280
So here now if I write HTML, look at that you get a nice little color completion.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.730
So for us, for now, we're going to be writing HTML, you can see over here that there's different options

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.350
there is - where is it...

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.190
There's CSS, Javascript - which we'll learn later, so we're going to be using Sublime Text for this. For

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.390
now,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.870
click on HTML, and let's write our very first web-page. In order for us to have a web page,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.400
we write 'HTML' which stands for HyperText Markup Language.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.650
So bear with me here,

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.120
This is going to be new.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.860
But keep in mind that this is exactly what every single HTML page has.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.540
These are the set of rules that all HTML files must follow.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.130
And it goes like this.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.100
We define a doctype, and don't worry I'll get into what that means in the next video

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.000
Then we have 'html' and we close the tags: '/html'

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.930
The second part, we have a 'head' and a closing '/head'.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.090
You can see over here, some patterns forming.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.380
Don't worry, I'll get back to these tags and explaining what they do, in a bit. And then we also have a 'body'

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.840
and then closing tags, '/body'.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:44.540
And finally here in the 'head' we have something called a 'title', that so this over here, is the rule that

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.250
every single HTML file must follow. So, just looking at this right now, without knowing any HTML,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.730
you can get an idea of what everything means.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.230
So 'html', we're defining that this is an HTML.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.230
We're saying that this is the 'head' of the HTML, with the title, and we're saying that this is the

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.500
'body' of the HTML.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.130
So let's try something here.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:17.310
Let's save this file, and we're going to save it - let's do 'Desktop', and we're going to call it,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.940
'index.html' - you can see that it's already completed the ‘html’ syntax for us. Save and we have

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.840
an index.html

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.070
file here.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.660
Let's drag this all the way down to our Google Chrome and open it up and, well, nothing happens.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.890
But, lets, add a bit of text to it.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.990
So in the title, I'm going to say, "My first website!".

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.840
And then in the body I'm just going to put "Hellooooooooo there.".

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.840
OK.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.100
So if I save this,

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.950
and just to show you, from now on I'm going to be doing 'CMD-S' to save, just to go faster.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:12.030
And now if I refresh this page I have, "Hellooooooooo there." and you can see the power over here, of what we just

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.790
did.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:23.620
We have "Hellooooooooo there." as the text, which is in the body, and then we also have "My first website!" as the

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.300
title.

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.190
And you can see over here in the file, that we're referencing 'index.html' on my Desktop.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.470
You can see here that we have 'html'.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.660
We have the 'head', which we haven't really talked about yet but, we see that the title is in the head, kind

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.090
of like a header. And then we have the body which, by looking at this, we can assume that it's whatever

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.880
shows up onto the web page. Before we expand on this and make it, a little bit prettier,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.970
because now it's just simple text.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:00.340
I want to reiterate the fact that what we've just done is very similar to what a server does.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.840
If we go back to our mock ups here, you remember that when we entered 'google.com' the servers send us

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:15.160
an HTML file, that when we moved the 'index.html' file all the way down to Google Chrome, that's

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.880
what we just did.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:25.030
We mimicked a server and we gave it to the browser to load up the HTML file and because browsers are

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:32.420
built to know what HTML files are, it can read the syntax and say OK this is HTML.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.980
OK.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.070
You want my 'title' to be' "My first website!", and you want my 'body' to say "Hellooooooooo there."

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.060
That's perfect.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.490
These are the default HTML rules.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.270
That you'll see all the time.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.500
It is a little bit confusing at first but this is it.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.000
You just have to remember that there is a tag.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:07:03.910
So, an 'html’ tag, a 'head' tag, a 'title' tag, a 'body' tag, and these tags usually have an opening and closing.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.570
There's some exceptions to this rule, and we'll get into that a little bit later on in the videos.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.410
But just remember this for now.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:16.730
So I wanted to try creating your very first web site and seeing how it works, and once you're done with

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.030
that

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.610
I want to show you that Sublime Text actually has a nice shortcut so you don't have to keep writing

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.080
those tags over and over.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.920
So, the way you do that is you type in, 'html' now, and then press the 'Tab' key and it loads all this up for

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.150
you.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:36.620
OK, so now that we've done this, I want you to go off and create your very first website.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:37.900
Now, I know it's very, very simple.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:41.150
You can put whatever you want in the title and you can put whatever you want

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:46.790
in the body. And in the next video we're going to start expanding on our first website.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.690
I'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye
