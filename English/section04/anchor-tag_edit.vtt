00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.799
And welcome back! In the previous videos we
talked about some of the most common a HTML tags

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.530
and how the HTML document
is read by the browser.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.449
However we've missed one critical feature of HTML,
and if we go back to our diagram here, that we

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:29.809
should remember from the first section the HTML
file gets sent to us but the power of HTML is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.689
in its ability to link to other document.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.970
So if I go back here to our website it's a simple one
page website but I can't really click on 'fuji',

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.490
or 'apple', or 'banana'.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.799
It doesn't link to anything.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.070
There must be a HTML tag that
we can use for that right?

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.700
Well yes there is.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.200
It's called a anchor tag.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.440
So an anchor tag is very easy just an 'a'.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:06.100
And this anchor tag has something called an 'href' which
is an attribute and it's the hypertext reference.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.289
So in this 'href' you'll be
able to link to something.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.360
Let's close this 'a' tag.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.560
An 'a' tag has an opening and closing tag.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.679
And if I save this and refresh the page, well nothing
happens because you need something in the anchor

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.140
tag.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.540
So let's do "New Page".

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.690
I save that, I refresh.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.809
And we have "New Page" here.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:40.510
Now if I click this, nothing happens. But you can see
that it has the link, and the mouse changes images,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.329
so it's clickable but nothing happens.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.600
Well that's because we need to
specify where we want the link to go.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.610
Now let's think about this if
we want to link to a new page.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.020
We don't really have another new
page, if you remember

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.330
We only have 'index.html'.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.200
Wouldn't it be great if there was
another file that we can link to?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.520
Well let's create another file.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.030
So let's open up Sublime Text,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.680
actually. I'm going to say 'File' 'New
File', I'm going to save this as 'newpage'

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.180
And we're going to save it to
desktop and see over here how,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.809
when I went to Sublime Text,

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.120
It's now a 'Plain Text'?

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:31.670
I need to make sure that this is an HTML file, so I
can just do 'newpage.html'. Save, and Sublime Text

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.159
automatically adjusts to the 'HTML'.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.310
So again I can type in that short command, 'html' and (then
press) 'Tab', that comes with Sublime Text, and let's do

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.730
the title 'New Page' and the 'body'

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.930
We can just do a header [h1] that
says, "This is the new page!"

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.290
If I save this... great! we have a new page. And if I go
to my desktop here, you see that I have 'newpage.html'

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.200
and 'index.html'.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.270
So how do we link these two together?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.129
Well it's very simple.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.380
We open up sublime again
and within 'index.html'.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:22.770
The 'href' can now say we're linking to 'newpage.html'.
Let's save that and let's give it a try.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.320
Refresh the page, click,

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.020
And "This is a new page!" awesome.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.580
But to go back we have to press the back symbol,
so let's link back to the original file again.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:46.160
We can do this by 'p' tag, which is for 'paragraph'
- I'm going to say 'Go Back'. Close that tag [/p].

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.800
But, hold on a minute.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.930
I need an anchor tag, right?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.169
If I just save this, and refresh the
page, I say, 'Go Back'.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:02.240
But what if you really, really want this to be a
paragraph, or let's say you want this to be an 'h2' but

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.340
you also want it to be an anchor tag.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.670
Well that's very simple you just
wrap it in an anchor tag [a].

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.480
And just so it's nice and clear,
we're going to have the nice spacing here.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.640
And again an anchor tag must have an 'href', which tells
us where to go. And we want to go to 'index.html'

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.460
So, 'index.html', save, and refresh.

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:28.870
Let's go back.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.110
Let's go to the next one, and back.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.850
So this is the power that comes with
HTML, this ability to link to other pages.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.969
And yeah, we can have text, we can have lists, we can
have images, but the true power is in this linking

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.040
ability. In the next episode
we're going to expand on this.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.410
I'll see you in that one. Bye-bye
