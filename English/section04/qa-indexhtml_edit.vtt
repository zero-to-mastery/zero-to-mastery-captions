And welcome to the student Q&amp;A
section as students take this course,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.150
usually I get a bunch of questions. Some of them
are really really good, some of them I get often.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.559
And we're going to use these Q&amp;A sections for me to
make a reply video to answer some of those really

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.560
really good questions.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.620
And the first thing we're going to
tackle for this video is 'index.html'.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.919
If we go back to our example that we had, you
noticed that I've always used 'index.html' as

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.850
the first page.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.100
And then we created 'newpage.html'.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.989
Now you might be asking
yourself why 'index.html'.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.940
Why not 'home.html', or 'apples.html'?
And you could actually do that.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.139
But I can explain this really
well by looking at this diagram.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.760
Most of the time there are
more than a few html files.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.470
You saw that with our example we had our
'index.html' and also 'newpage.html'.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:11.389
But when we make that request to let's say google.com,
how does the server know which html (file) to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.780
return first for the homepage?

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.350
And you could go into the server and configure it
and tell it you know what I want 'about.html' to

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:28.969
be the first page. But, by default most servers just
say, "I'll return 'index.html'- if I see 'index.html'

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.300
in the servers, I'll just return that."

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.489
So this is just a common practice that you'll see
in a lot of the projects that a lot of the websites

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.390
that you'll work with,

00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:43.480
is that 'index.html' is usually, you can think
of it as the home-page, the first a HTML file

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.350
that the server returns.

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:53.769
And if anybody in the 'index.html' clicks on that
link, then it will return whichever link they return.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.850
So there will be - let's say they click on 'About'
anchor tag, then they'll get 'about.html'.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.860
So that's it.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.320
That is your answer to your question.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.870
I'll see in the next one. Bye-bye
