00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.240
And welcome back.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.029
In this video we're going to be
learning about self-closing tags.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:14.339
Up until this point we use all tags that have the
opening and then the closing which has this slash

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.419
in it.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.139
Now there are a few elements that don't have this
syntax but they have something called 'self-closing

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.800
tags'.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.579
So let's say here between Fuji and Honeycrisp
I want to have a bit of a line break.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.430
I can use something like 'br' here
and if I save this and I 'refresh',

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.680
we have a little line break.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.740
There's also 'hr' which is horizontal line,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.730
so you get a horizontal line
for refresh right through here.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.460
'hr' tags just have one single
element, self-closing.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.579
You might also see something like this, and that
is something from the old version of HTML, which

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.420
uses xHTML.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.319
You can read up more about it on your own, but just
keep in mind that with HTML5, we are just going

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.200
to be using this.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.759
So obviously on web pages
there's going to be images.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.250
So would it be nice if there was
a picture of a Fuji apple here.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.330
Let's see how we can do it.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.829
So with an image tag, and let's think about this
critically if I didn't know what an image tag is and

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:33.119
I wanted to add an image to my HTML file, well
if I Google "image HTML tag", again one of the

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:42.750
first websites that pops up is the W3 Schools, and
I'll show you exactly how an image tag works.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.009
If I click try yourself you can see it in action
you can play around with but you can see here that

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.029
an image tag is a self-closing tag.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.130
There's no closing image tags
just just one single tag.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:05.050
And if I do image [img] and we have something called
source here and this is something called an attribute

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.709
some HTML tags can have something called attributes,
which add special properties to the specific

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.410
tag.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.949
So an attribute always has a value attached
to it and the image source [img src].

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.089
That's what it stands for,
tells us where the image is coming from.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:36.770
So let's find an image of fuji apple let's go, images, oh, I
like this one. Let's do 'view image' and give us the link

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.109
of where this image is.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.770
So I'm just going to copy
that paste it in here.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:49.729
Let's go back to our example here we can see here
that there's a few more attributes that we can add

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:50.860
to an image tag.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.510
But for now we can just
leave it here close the tag.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:05.250
You can see that Sublime Text has the nice highlighting
for us and if I save this go back to our website

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:13.700
and I click refresh I get this massive fuji
apple, and obviously that's that's too big.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.279
Ideally we can make it a little bit smaller again
if we go back to the example you'll see that there

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:29.780
has width and height so we can actually just copy
that and add it to the attributes so that we specify

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.420
the width.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.420
And this is in pixels [px].

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.160
So I save that, I refresh and look at that we
have the fuji apple, it looks very very pretty.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.680
Let's add the picture
for honeycrisp as well.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.120
I'm going to do this fast.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.410
You should be able to just copy this image.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.760
And again we want to make it the same size as the
previous one so I'm going to leave the width and height

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.450
the same.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.599
And let's find a - an image
of a honeycrisp apple.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:07.040
So, 'honeycrisp apple' and 'Images',
it looks quite similar doesn't it?

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:16.400
And 'view image' let's copy the
source from here going to save that.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.080
Go back to our website and
let's refresh and look at that.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.499
We have our apples.
So, image tags are very very useful.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.940
You might be asking yourself,
"what does the 'alt' attribute mean?"

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.189
And this is something that you can actually read up
on so if you scroll down if you look over here you

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.019
can see that 'alt' specifies
an alternate text for an image.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.589
So again, this is something that can be used by screen
readers and you can define what the image is of.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.960
So, here the 'alt' is "smiley face".

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.249
So when a screen reader reads it, it says, "Oh and
this part of the website there is a smiley face".

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.000
Just to recap, we learned about
self-closing tags - which don't require

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.530
two of them, so an opening and closing tag.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.720
Just a single one.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.269
So we use 'br' for line break.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:18.580
We used 'hr' for a horizontal line, and then we have
the image tag that also has to have some attributes.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.100
So, it has a source which tells
us where to grab the image from,

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.219
it has a width attribute, a height attribute,
with a value of 42 pixels, and 42.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.790
All right I'll see you in the next lesson.
