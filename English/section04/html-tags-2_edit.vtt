00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.580
And welcome back. In the previous video we talked
about a few of the common tags that HTML uses.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.709
We're going to expand on that knowledge and learn a few
more. So, I'm going to delete these, and I'm going

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.280
to teach you about something
called an 'Ordered List'.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:24.020
So an 'ol' tag, and within this
tag we have list 'li' items -

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:39.610
'banana' and, another list item,
'apple', and lastly let's do, 'orange'.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.139
So if I save this, again, I refresh and we have banana,
apple, orange. So you can see here this is how you

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.310
make lists.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.420
And this is an 'Ordered List' so
you can see we have '1, 2, 3'.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.290
If we want to make it without the numbers, we
use something called an 'Unordered List', 'ul'.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.360
And again I save that,
and refresh, and we have these.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.409
Now there's also subfields
that you can use.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.690
So again this is all about nesting,
and having parent tags, and children tags.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:18.020
So let's say within 'apples' we wanted to have -
let me structure that are a little bit cleaner,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.949
there you go, within 'apples'.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.100
We also want to emphasize that there is the
'fuji' apple and there is 'honey crisp'.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.500
And while I can't think of a third type of apple, so,
I'm going to delete that. If I save this, and refresh,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.149
well, we have a nested list. There you have it you have
your list items. I'll see in the next video, where

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.370
we're going to learn about putting images
into our website and self-closing tags.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.380
See you in the next one.
