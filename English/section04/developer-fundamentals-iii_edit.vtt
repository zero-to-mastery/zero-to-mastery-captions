00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.880
And welcome back.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.120
In the previous video we went over the basic
rules that all HTML files must follow.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.299
And I kind of glossed over this '!DOCTYPE html'
tag, and I did that on purpose because I want

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.590
you to develop a another
developer fundamental concept.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.390
And that is the fact that most of the time, as
developers there's so much information out there that

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.780
there's no way that you can
keep all of that in your head.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.619
And as developers we must get really
really good at problem solving.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:42.969
So for the doctype let's say if I was working and
somebody gives me this file and I say OK I've got

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.999
this that's good but I'm
not sure what 'doctype' is.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.479
Well again we wanna get really good at Googling here, and
I know it sounds silly, but trust me, as a developer

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.530
you're going to be Googling a lot and going to get really
really good at looking for answers and understanding

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:00.890
meanings behind code.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.710
So, if I go into 'doctype html' and we Google that,
one of the first things that we get is the W3 School

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:17.179
and this is a resource that I highly, highly recommend.
They'll actually explain what the doctype is, and

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.090
even show you a demo of what it does.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.890
You can read into this and get more familiar with it,
but the general rule and the concept behind 'doctype'

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.480
is that 'doctype' says to the browser, 'Hey just
a heads up this file is going to use HTML5.'

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.899
And we'll get into what HTML5, is but right now,
HTML has evolved from back in the day when Tim

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.069
Berners-Lee invented it, to where it is now. And it
has developed and evolved so that it has a few more

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.000
tags,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.919
it has a few more features, and this is the way for us
to say, 'Hey, browser we're going to be using HTML5.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.829
So please make sure that you load the website properly.'
And we'll get into what those new tags are and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.160
some of the new syntaxes.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.810
But again most likely in your day to day job you're
going to be writing this at the top because we're

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.330
writing in HTML5, if that ever
changes and something new comes along,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.180
we might change this,
but 'doctype' that's what it is.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.609
But the key concept here is that I really want you
to start Googling, at any time you see in my videos,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.540
something that you don't fully understand
or you want to dig a little bit deeper.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.489
You really want to grow those roots of your foundation
so that you really understand how the landscape

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.120
works.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.520
OK.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.440
So I just wanted to get that concept across that
as a developer, you really want to understand

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.920
how things work and what they mean,
and you'll come across in your day to day

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.670
many things that it's very easy to
just, on the surface copy and paste,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.470
or just look at an example and do it
without fully understanding what it does.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.679
But the developers that get really really good salaries,
really good jobs, and are considered 'senior developers'

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.720
are the ones that fully understand all the
meaning behind the things that they do.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.850
We're going to be taking that throughout the course
and making sure that we develop those fundamentals.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.560
But any time, like I said, you have any questions
or you don't understand something fully,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.169
I do encourage you to Google and get the answers
because there's a ton of free resources out there for

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.700
you to get fully,
fully comfortable with the topic.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.210
I'll see you in the next one.
