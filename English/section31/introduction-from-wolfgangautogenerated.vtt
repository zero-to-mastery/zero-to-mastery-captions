Hello and welcome to the section for Windows users you might ask yourself.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.280
Wait hold on a sec who is this guy.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.600
This is not Andre.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.950
Did I pick the wrong course.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.860
Don't worry you are on the right course.

00:16.860 --> 00:23.570
Let me introduce myself and Wolfgang you might know me already from the Q and A or from this court.

00:23.910 --> 00:27.170
I work full stock developer in 2010.

00:27.510 --> 00:30.420
Since 2011 I've worked as a paramedic.

00:30.420 --> 00:36.320
I also enrolled in this course in February 2000 18 and finished it on April 2018.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.030
Andrei gave me back my passion again about full stock development.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.100
I made our project work on my computer and helped.

00:44.100 --> 00:47.000
Also a few students to make it work for them.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.100
Now I got this great opportunity to show you how you can make all the tools that you need throughout

00:53.100 --> 00:55.210
this course work on your system.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.660
Enough about me.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.670
Let us dive into the first lecture where we talk about the installation of good on Windows.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.200
