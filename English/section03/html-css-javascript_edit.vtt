WEBVTT

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.359
And welcome back!

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.039
In the last section we talked about the world wide
web and the Internet and what the differences were

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.620
and then I promised you that we'd finally
talk about some HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.249
So I've been vaguely referencing these files and
just told you that they're simple text files for now

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.680
but what are they specifically.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.249
Well initially if you remember we had Tim Berners-Lee,
who created the very first website and this

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.460
Website uses

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.150
HTML, and HTML -

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.669
that's the first file over here, is a way for us to
just write text on websites and these text on web

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.400
sites can also have these things called hyperlinks
that can link to other parts of the website.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:56.349
So that's what happened in 1991. 1991, we had a way for
us to share documents and this can link to another

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.990
website,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.220
another file, another research paper. But,
as you can see it wasn't the prettiest.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.280
So in 1995 - 1996 two
technologies came into being.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.690
One was CSS and one is Javascript.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.470
Now what did they allow you to do?

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.549
Well CSS solved the problem of, well this is nice and
all, but wouldn't it be nice if we had some visual

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.630
aspects we can toy around with this website, make it
look pretty and then Javascript said, well you know

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.079
ideally we'll be able to have something like this
website where you know I can click over here I can

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.569
'Shop Now', I can put in my credit card and get these
fancy slippers and I can do all these interactive

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.700
things with my website.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:53.859
So let's play around with this and try and incorporate
from this basic HTML file to add some CSS, and

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.420
Javascript to this page.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.770
The way we're going to do that is we're going to go into
'View', 'Developer', and 'Developer Tools'. you must

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.290
- you might remember this
from our previous lessons.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.319
So once you click on that you'll get this pop up at
the bottom of the screen, for some of you might be

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.100
on the right side but it doesn't
matter you'll get both things.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.720
And we've seen this before and if you
look at the top over here it says 'HTML'.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.490
And that's it.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:30.479
HTML is this, it's this file that has this weird
syntax that describes how this web page should look in

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.870
text.

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.170
You can see over here,
it says 'The World Wide Web'.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.609
These are just text. On the right side,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:43.860
over here, you'll see something called styles. So
styles will actually let you add styles to the website,

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.300
as the name suggests
and that's what CSS is.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:55.640
If we click on 'HTML' here and actually, let's click on
'body' without knowing any CSS or anything, if we define

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:06.389
something like color, semicolon, and then let's go 'blue',
it changes the text color to blue. Chrome lets you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.440
play around with websites and actually inject some
CSS into this HTML. Without knowing any CSS,

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.769
we can kind of play around, type in a letter and it
will have a dropdown. So let's see over here if we

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:28.050
can do 'background-color', lets make it in our press
tab and to do 'red', make the website really, really,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.769
well, frankly, pretty ugly. But thats CSS right here
- we've just added some CSS to this basic website.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.260
Let's turn this red color
off, because it is not pretty.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.060
OK.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.050
So HTML, text, and links,
CSS, pretty colors.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.840
Now how can we add some Javascript?

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.530
So remember we have three files over here.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.230
Javascript came along
and said these are great.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.199
You know we have these beautiful text websites that
link to other pages and we have CSS that, its, you

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.389
you can make websites
really, really pretty.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.279
But would it be nice to have some interactivity to
have drop-down menus to make websites like they

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.698
are now, interactive.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.939
We can actually do this again
with the developer tools.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.760
If you click on 'Console' over here, without knowing
any bit of Javascript, for now, we're just going to

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:28.030
show you a simple Javascript line, and we're going
to type in 'alert' and let's say "hi there!!!",

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.190
and I press enter and look at that.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.309
We just made the very first website
ever made, interactive with Javascript.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.940
Now obviously this doesn't do anything, but
hopefully this shows you where we were before

00:04:48.810 --> 00:05:01.340
in 1991 to where we are now, websites that are
interactive, full of Javascript CSS and of course HTML.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:03.800
See you in the next one, bye.
