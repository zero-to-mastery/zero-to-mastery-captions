00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.979
Hello and welcome back to another video - we actually
have a couple of great videos coming up about the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.440
history of the web and
you might be asking again,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.859
"Come on, let's get to coding",
but this is really important because

00:00:14.183 --> 00:00:16.159
we need to understand what problems we had

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.240
in the past and how we found solutions to those
problems and where we are at now. We need to understand

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.649
what this whole thing of being a web developer means
and what problems we're solving and what we did

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.030
in the past and what we do today.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.559
So today we're going to talk about Tim Berners-Lee,
the person who invented the World Wide Web in 1989

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.479
and I have a picture of him right here and we're
going to talk about him because he's the first web

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.170
developer.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.829
And in order to explain that concept we need
to make a distinction between the Internet

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.130
and the World Wide Web.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.589
I have this website that I'll
share in the links below.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.350
It's really really good if you kind
of want to get a history lesson.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.880
But essentially the Internet started off with the
Arpanet in 1969, basically a military project

00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:01.999
and was more of a test.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.830
It connected a few universities such as
Utah, UCLA and throughout the 70s the 80s.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.050
It kept growing but there was one problem that they
had and that was essentially for the academics.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.550
They needed a way to share documents and up until
the World Wide Web existed the Internet was there

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:30.250
but it was really really hard for computers to
communicate with each other to share academic papers

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.410
between each other.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.650
Most of the time each computer
had their own way of doing things.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.379
Or you can think of this as languages so it's kind
of like communicating with people from different

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.090
countries and a language
that you don't know.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.449
Yeah sure you can make it work
but it's very very difficult.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.160
So that was the problem.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.019
And Tim Berners-Lee what he did and he was working
at CERN at the time he actually created the World

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.980
Wide Web and what the worldwide web is it's the
'www' that we see whenever we type in Google.com

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.080
over here.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.899
Is essentially a common language
that computers can speak.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.989
With the worldwide web saying hey from now on
everybody if we want to communicate together if we

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.229
want to share images or if you want to share files
let's just have this agreed upon language agreed

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.309
upon protocol in order to
share these documents together.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.540
So that's what it is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.569
those servers the HTML, CSS, Javascript, the browsers
all work on top of the World Wide Web so you can

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.989
think of it as the Internet as your phone and the
World Wide Web is Instagram that runs on your phone.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.500
So it's essentially a
decentralized application.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.660
Now, how is Tim Berners-Lee
the first web developer?

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.519
He actually created the first browser and the
first server and later on we're actually going to

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.060
talk about what he did with
the files over here as well.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:59.460
But he created the very very first server and
web browser but also the first web site.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.280
And they actually still have a copy of it.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.309
This is the very first web
site ever and it's from 1991.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.789
And this is what it looked like, and he created this
ability for people to communicate and link to other

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.359
documents, so that we have this growing knowledge
base of the world. In the next lesson we're going to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.520
be talking about the
history of these files,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.540
What they mean, what problem they solved, and how
they came to be. I'll see you in the next one.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.319
Bye-bye.
