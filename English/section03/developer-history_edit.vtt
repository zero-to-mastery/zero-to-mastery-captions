00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.910
And welcome back to the final lesson
from 'The History of the Web'.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.759
I wanted to finish things off with this diagram that
we've seen before in previous lessons, with a few

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.850
minor differences.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.200
And that is, I wanted to show you how web
applications were built in the early 2000s.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.770
So they were built with technologies that
we've come to familiarize ourselves with.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.510
We have HTML, CSS, Javascript, but we also had
JQuery, and JQuery was a library that allowed

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:41.609
Javascript to be written in a simple, clean way that
allowed us not to worry too much about working in

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.030
one browser, then the other.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.299
It created this environment for Javascript to
flourish but it is an outdated technology and there's

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.559
better ways of doing things.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.820
So it is not used very often and you'll
see it less and less in job postings.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:09.279
And then on the back-end we have the LAMP stack
that stands for Linux Apache MySQL, and PHP.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:18.690
And in those days, back-end developers used PHP to write
files that allowed us to have logic on the servers.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.000
And then we had Apache.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:29.179
So if you ever use something like HostGator and
you had to log in to cPanel, or any of those very

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.400
common hosting platforms,
most likely they're running Apache server.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.189
And what it is - it's a software that really efficiently
serves up files, and PHP is a language that is

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.170
still being used today and
Facebook actually uses it.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.520
But that's because their website
was built in the early 2000s.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:57.060
It is now a very unpopular, let's say, language
in terms of growth and job opportunities.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.310
And then we also had MySQL,
which it's still being used.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.370
But again if you're looking to get hired and you
want to look for skills that are highly employable

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:13.260
people are looking for them and there are still
very few developers that know it really well.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.150
Well that's what we're learning in this course,
and this course we're going to learn HTML5, CSS3,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.390
we're going to learn Javascript.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:30.049
We're going to learn React, probably
biggest library for Javascript and we're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.949
going to learn about Node servers, Node.JS, Express.JS,
we're going to learn about PostgreSQL, and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:36.999
also MongoDB.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.260
So we're learning all these things in order for us
to build clean, fast, and bug free web applications

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.629
so that we can stand on shoulders of giants, so we
can create wonderful applications that we're proud

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.300
of. So get excited.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.810
All the theory stuff, we're done with.
We're going to start coding.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.239
We're going to start off with HTML, then get into
CSS, and then finally Javascript, and React. And

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.540
don't worry,
we'll get to the back-end as well.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.960
So I'll see in the next section. Bye-bye.
