00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.200
And welcome back.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.850
In this final video I want to show you what this
course is all about what we're learning in this course

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.630
and what we're going to
be able to do at the end.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.090
You may have heard the term full-stack developer
front-end developer, back-end developer. And looking at

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.190
this diagram

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.809
you start to recognize that, HTML, CSS Javascript
you see React in there, we'll get to that,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.670
don't worry about it but that's what a front-end
developer does. The front-end developer is the person

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.800
who makes sure that, when we open up the browser
and go to Google.com that we see Google, we see it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.879
nice and pretty laid out beautifully, has a search
bar, essentially anything that a user sees, the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.260
front-end developer does. And that is using HTML,
CSS, Javascript, React and a few other tools.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.049
The back-end developer, that's a person that works
with the server makes sure that when a browser speaks

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.049
to it, it serves up those files and uses some technology
such as Node.js, Express.js, which we're going

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.199
to get into, and then that server is going to talk
also to a database; again we haven't really discussed

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.180
that too much but don't worry there's going to be a
section on it and that's going to use PostgreSQL

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.270
and we're actually going to
be learning that as well.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:22.230
So we want to build you up as a full-stack developer to
be able to work with all these technologies, so that

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.230
everything revolving
around a web application,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.419
you're able to build, so get excited.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.669
You're going to learn all of this.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.640
It looks overwhelming, but trust me, just like this How
the Internet Works section it's all going to make sense.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.480
So I'll see you at the next one. Bye-bye.
