00:01.090 --> 00:04.580
Phew! Can you believe you've made it, this far?

00:04.680 --> 00:12.090
I mean at the beginning of this, you probably had no idea, what any of this means and now look at you, you know

00:12.090 --> 00:14.680
what every single line means.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.390
You know what.

00:16.730 --> 00:19.120
This is pretty much it, for HTML.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.660
It's not very hard.

00:20.660 --> 00:26.000
You just have to remember a few tags and it's very easy to test around and play.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.460
So call yourself an HTML developer!

00:32.040 --> 00:38.430
I have a fun little game for you, as you can see over here, we've created a simple web page, where I can

00:38.520 --> 00:39.830
link to another page.

00:39.840 --> 00:46.110
I can go back, I can even click on register and submit a form.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.580
I want you to try your hand at building your own little website here.

00:50.710 --> 00:57.300
And once you're done, I'll provide the link to my email in the description below.

00:57.340 --> 01:05.260
Send me your first web site and I'll showcase some of my favorite ones, in an upcoming video.

01:05.350 --> 01:06.570
I'll see you in the next one.

01:06.770 --> 01:07.050
Bye-bye
