00:00.360 --> 00:00.870
Welcome back.

00:01.560 --> 00:10.100
I want to talk to you about two other new U.S. 2018 features and to show you how they work.

00:10.110 --> 00:18.000
We're going to use the example that we had before in the video about promises where we loop through

00:18.000 --> 00:22.010
all these you are L's are Star Wars API.

00:22.140 --> 00:30.240
Well we fetched the data and then we just console logged whatever we received so that if I copy this

00:31.020 --> 00:39.910
and paste it into our console we get our users.

00:40.060 --> 00:44.820
We have Luke Skywalker C3 peo r2 d2 and Darth Vader.

00:44.950 --> 00:51.250
And if this doesn't look familiar to you Make sure you check out the promises videos first before tackling

00:51.280 --> 00:52.360
this one.

00:52.450 --> 00:59.800
Now the first feature I'm going to talk about that's new in Javascript is called finally and as the

00:59.800 --> 01:03.050
name suggests it allows us to do something.

01:03.070 --> 01:11.820
Finally after a promise has finished and the way it works is we added usually at the end.

01:12.850 --> 01:22.720
And this finally block will be called regardless of whether dot then works or the promise airs and catches

01:22.840 --> 01:24.060
into an error.

01:24.130 --> 01:26.310
So no matter what.

01:26.440 --> 01:31.540
After everything is done inside of a promise Finally you will be called.

01:31.540 --> 01:39.100
Whether it resolves or rejects and does something that we tell it to in our case let's say I can have

01:39.190 --> 01:47.350
data here and this data will just console dialog to see what we get and we'll just say extra

01:52.640 --> 01:59.890
so that when we run this one more time I'm going to copy let's refresh here.

01:59.950 --> 02:08.160
Copy and paste I hit enter we get extra over here but undefined.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.490
And that is because finally doesn't really receive a parameter.

02:11.550 --> 02:16.020
So this is usually empty doesn't receive anything from the promise.

02:16.380 --> 02:18.690
So we can just leave this out.

02:19.460 --> 02:25.990
But you see here that I was able to call extra even though the dot then finished.

02:26.060 --> 02:35.300
But what happens if we throw an error and a catch block gets called we can simulate that fairly easily.

02:35.970 --> 02:45.280
We can just do inside of dot then in JavaScript back and throw an error by saying throw Error and what's

02:45.280 --> 02:54.280
going to happen here is as soon as this line reaches it's going to throw an error skip over all these

02:54.280 --> 03:05.500
console logs and hit the cache block with this error parameter so if I say this or let's copy this going

03:05.500 --> 03:15.180
to refresh the page copy and paste and let's see what happens down here I'm going to hit enter and we

03:15.180 --> 03:24.880
see that oh we get the error the cache block has run with our error but we also have the extra being

03:24.880 --> 03:28.150
called which is finally.

03:28.150 --> 03:36.240
So finally is great for those times that you need to run a piece of code no matter what.

03:36.340 --> 03:43.870
After a promise perhaps you want to send an email to a user regardless of whether their request was

03:43.870 --> 03:45.590
successful or failed.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.530
Maybe you want to have a little notification icon.

03:48.550 --> 03:54.100
There are many ways to use finally and now there is a way to make sure that something happens after

03:54.100 --> 03:55.390
a promise.

03:55.390 --> 04:04.990
Whatever we tell it to now the next one I want to talk about is a little bit more advanced in order

04:04.990 --> 04:05.850
to explain it.

04:05.860 --> 04:19.340
Let's clean this up and talk about the for a wait of feature now if you remember we had this piece of

04:19.340 --> 04:29.420
code in our async await video and there I showed you how we're able to use the async await feature of

04:29.690 --> 04:37.610
yes eight to make our promises more synchronous looking instead of having those promised change of dot

04:37.640 --> 04:48.440
then DOD then DOD then dot catch we can use async await now the cool thing about this new feature is

04:48.440 --> 04:57.260
that it allows us to loop through our async await calls if we have multiple of them just like we are

04:57.260 --> 05:06.410
able to using the for of so using the for of loop that allowed us to iterate over intervals we're now

05:06.410 --> 05:14.060
able to iterate over the await promises that we're going to have but instead of talking let me show

05:14.060 --> 05:22.660
you in code now let's say we'll use this as an example we're gonna create a new function and this is

05:22.660 --> 05:32.590
going to be called get data to actually let's remember what the for of loop looks like if I had a function

05:32.680 --> 05:44.980
let's call it loop through your ls that receives the your l parameter and it will loop using the for

05:45.190 --> 05:54.640
loop will say you are all of you are ls and the you are ls is this array over here with 3 or else and

05:54.640 --> 06:00.140
this for all loop is simply going to a loop through everything and we can just log out there you are

06:00.150 --> 06:13.920
about fight copy and paste this let's refresh here hit enter and just do loop through your ls now and

06:13.920 --> 06:22.380
pass into your else parameter I see that I'm just looping through these so that's what 4 of was.

06:22.380 --> 06:31.230
So using that knowledge we can now create a new function called get data to add this new function we'll

06:31.230 --> 06:38.870
do exactly what this one does above by using these for a weight of feature let's see how that would

06:38.870 --> 06:39.550
look.

06:39.770 --> 06:49.400
We will have an async function so that we can use the awake keyword and then here we can have an array

06:49.940 --> 07:01.240
of promises because an array of promises is irritable and able to be looped by the for a weight of keywords

07:02.530 --> 07:12.900
so these arrays of promises will simply be are your Ls thought map that will loop and let's make this

07:12.900 --> 07:22.230
a little bit bigger so we can see that's better we're going to loop over the you are well and it's going

07:22.230 --> 07:30.650
to return the fetch you are well so and here in the first line all we're doing is creating an array

07:30.890 --> 07:36.560
of these fetch promises of each one of these requests

07:40.690 --> 07:50.500
next we can use them for a wait of to loop through these promises so all we would say is say for a wait

07:51.610 --> 07:55.390
and then here we'll say let request

08:00.120 --> 08:08.130
array of promises which is an admirable is going to loop through each of these promises each of the

08:08.130 --> 08:19.060
requests and we're going to extract that data from each of the requests by saying oh wait request dropped.

08:19.110 --> 08:25.310
Jason because remember we used the awake keyword in front of a promise.

08:25.450 --> 08:33.820
And as we know we're using the wait keyword here because we're looping over our promises and we need

08:33.820 --> 08:36.600
to await request.

08:36.640 --> 08:41.650
Jason which again is a promise that receives our data.

08:41.650 --> 08:49.830
Remember similar to how we did here before and then we simply cancelled our log let's say data to see

08:49.890 --> 08:55.140
while we get Fi clear this and let's just copy our new code

08:58.020 --> 09:03.800
make this a little bit bigger and make sure I don't have the semicolon then I have it here.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.980
So let's copy the you or else refresh a page.

09:08.070 --> 09:14.140
Copy that you URLs and then we'll also copy the function paste it in here.

09:14.310 --> 09:23.990
Hit enter and let's just clear this and if I do get data to now when I run this we see that look at

09:23.990 --> 09:32.690
that we've received first the users which are right here let's make this a little bit bigger so we can

09:32.690 --> 09:43.850
see we have the users and the next stop we have what do we have next.

09:43.930 --> 09:52.710
We have the posts so a hundred posts and then the next stop is the album's just like that

09:58.370 --> 10:03.610
and this is the new Yes 2018 feature as you see here.

10:03.650 --> 10:06.200
It's the exact same thing as we did above.

10:06.620 --> 10:11.410
If I run our original function get data

10:18.390 --> 10:28.360
we see that we get the exact same results you have albums we have post we have users.

10:28.570 --> 10:37.390
The only thing that the for a wait of feature does it allows us to loop through these multiple promises

10:38.350 --> 10:48.150
almost as if we're writing synchronous code right so to review we have the finally function that we

10:48.150 --> 10:56.280
can run at the end of a promise and we have the for a weight of that takes each item from an array of

10:56.400 --> 11:01.590
promises that returns to us in the correct order.

11:01.590 --> 11:03.890
All the responses.

11:03.980 --> 11:04.400
All right.

11:04.590 --> 11:05.590
I think that's enough.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.990
It's time for you to play around with this.

11:08.010 --> 11:09.490
I'll see you in the next video.

11:09.500 --> 11:09.960
Bye bye.
