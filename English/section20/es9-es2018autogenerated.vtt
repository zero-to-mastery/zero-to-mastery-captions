00:01.570 --> 00:02.110
Welcome back.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.570
Let's talk about yes 9 or yes.

00:05.610 --> 00:13.450
Twenty eighteen there are three main new features that you should be aware of for this version of Back

00:13.450 --> 00:24.030
must script the first one is the object spread operator and it looks something like this if we had an

00:24.120 --> 00:33.780
object let's say animals and this animal's object has a tiger that has age of twenty three I don't know

00:33.780 --> 00:39.080
how old Tigers get let's say twenty three we have a lion that is five.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.350
Sure I add the commas

00:43.780 --> 00:53.800
and let's say a monkey that is two there's a cute little monkey with the new object spread operator

00:54.310 --> 01:03.830
let's say I d structure here and say I'll take out Tiger and I can do.

01:03.830 --> 01:11.030
Dot dot dot and I can call it whatever I want here let's say let's call it arrest equals to animals

01:12.570 --> 01:18.960
well what's going to happen here is I'm going to grab Tiger and the rest is going to include lion and

01:18.960 --> 01:19.800
monkey.

01:19.800 --> 01:20.980
Let's have a look.

01:21.060 --> 01:28.690
I'm going to copy this paste it on here though and I have to refresh.

01:28.720 --> 01:30.460
Let's try that again.

01:30.460 --> 01:39.790
Now if I grab Tiger I see that Tiger is twenty three but if I grab a rest I see that rest now includes

01:40.060 --> 01:49.310
lion and monkey and this is something that we were able to do with a race in yes six in E6 I could have

01:49.310 --> 01:54.230
done an array that had 1 2 3 4 5

01:57.370 --> 02:11.270
and let's say we had a function that we call some that takes a b c d and let's say E and simply returns

02:11.930 --> 02:17.750
a plus b plus c plus D plus E

02:20.560 --> 02:34.260
Well if I copy this here paste it I could have done some dot dot dot array which as we can see here

02:34.650 --> 02:35.820
gives us the answer.

02:35.820 --> 02:46.110
Fifteen I was able to spread the arrays over these parameters so that it was the same thing I was doing.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.040
One two three four five

02:53.560 --> 02:59.650
and this new feature of objects spread operator just means we're able to do this with an object as well

03:00.310 --> 03:09.670
so that in the same manner if we had a function let's call it object spread that has let's say parameter

03:09.670 --> 03:16.900
one parameter to parameter 3 and let's say we'll console log p 1

03:21.740 --> 03:23.390
P2 and P3

03:26.490 --> 03:32.250
if I run this function saying object spread and let's bring this down here

03:35.040 --> 03:44.310
and we'll give it Tiger rest and actually let's add one more here let's add bird that is forty that's

03:44.310 --> 03:49.080
an old bird and we'll take out line here.

03:49.080 --> 04:02.500
So if I do tiger lion rest here and I run this function let's see what happens press center Well I've

04:02.500 --> 04:10.240
got a refreshes so that it sees the variables as new variables and there we go.

04:10.240 --> 04:20.300
We have twenty three which is the Tiger that is p 1 then we have the 5 which is the lion and then monkey

04:20.300 --> 04:26.710
and bird as the second or the third parameter and I know what you're thinking.

04:26.780 --> 04:33.170
You're saying Andre I'm pretty sure we're able to do this in the react section of the course.

04:33.170 --> 04:40.040
And if you've caught onto that good job in react when we're building our robo friends app we're able

04:40.040 --> 04:45.830
to do this especially in redux where we learned about producers and if you don't remember it or you

04:45.830 --> 04:52.680
haven't watched that section don't worry about it and the reason that this worked and react was that

04:53.340 --> 04:54.790
create react app.

04:54.960 --> 05:02.470
Remember the tool that we use to build our ReACT application was using objects spread operator by default

05:02.500 --> 05:07.280
even though it wasn't officially part of JavaScript because it was so useful.

05:07.420 --> 05:14.620
But now that it's part of JavaScript officially as of yes 2018 you can use it freely.
