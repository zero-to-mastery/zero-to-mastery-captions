00:01.000 --> 00:07.210
Welcome back. In the last video we talked about the Document Object Model and some of you might have

00:07.210 --> 00:08.240
a question.

00:08.590 --> 00:17.550
Well when he showed me window it looked like an object. You have properties and methods.

00:17.840 --> 00:24.360
But whenever we access the DOM, the document, well it doesn't look like the object does it?

00:24.550 --> 00:26.630
It looks like HTML.

00:26.950 --> 00:31.120
And that is because Web browsers just hide the fact that it's an object.

00:31.120 --> 00:36.380
They just give us a nice view like this so we can play around with it better.

00:36.520 --> 00:39.870
But it is a Javascript object.

00:39.910 --> 00:46.060
Now with this document we can use something called Selectors to select different elements so we can

00:46.060 --> 00:47.840
manipulate them.

00:47.920 --> 00:53.710
So I'm going to show you a few of them today the ones that are used most often that you'll encounter

00:54.010 --> 00:55.530
in your day today.

00:55.690 --> 01:06.070
Web Developer role. If you go to document the first one I'm going to show you is getElementsByTagName.

01:07.230 --> 01:11.580
As the name suggests it accepts a tag name.

01:11.580 --> 01:19.230
In our case if we look at our index HTML file well I've created for you a shopping list and if

01:19.230 --> 01:21.630
I minimize this just so you can see it.

01:21.930 --> 01:26.420
We have a simple HTML file and it looks like it's an important shopping list.

01:26.430 --> 01:29.280
It might be somebody's birthday and they're getting a notebook.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.050
All right.

01:30.180 --> 01:33.010
So with the tag name I can say well what tag do.

01:33.020 --> 01:38.280
I want to select, I want to select the H1 tag or press enter and look at that.

01:38.610 --> 01:40.470
I get the H1 tag.

01:40.500 --> 01:40.730
OK.

01:40.740 --> 01:42.260
What else can I do?

01:42.390 --> 01:51.520
I can do document.getElementsbyClassName.

01:51.750 --> 01:59.260
And here I can say, within the index file I have class 'second' which is the second paragraph that says

01:59.290 --> 02:01.180
no excuses.

02:01.180 --> 02:04.600
So I can say 'second' I look at that.

02:04.730 --> 02:07.560
Now I have the 'second' element.

02:07.570 --> 02:10.910
When else do we have? getElementById.

02:11.020 --> 02:16.750
I think you can guess what this one is going to do, document.getElementsById.

02:16.840 --> 02:25.430
Again we're going to select Id of we see that there's a first year, so we can do first, and I get the

02:25.430 --> 02:26.100
Id.

02:27.300 --> 02:33.210
Now you see one difference here that getElementById doesn't have the plural.

02:33.210 --> 02:36.530
That's right. Because you can only have one Id.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.910
It returns the full element versus 

02:38.950 --> 02:40.750
well looks like an array.

02:41.190 --> 02:50.210
So in order for me to actually fully access the above I'll have to do 'second' and then access the zero

02:50.260 --> 02:54.310
index of the array in which case I get no excuses.

02:56.370 --> 02:57.150
All right.

02:57.460 --> 03:00.940
So these three are very very useful.

03:00.940 --> 03:06.680
But there is something called querySelector and querySelectorAll which are even better.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.950
Let's check them out. With document.querySelector

03:12.200 --> 03:20.800
I can select anything inside here like I did with CCS. For example if I wanted to select let's do

03:20.810 --> 03:32.460
in this case H1 or I can select H1 if I wanted to select 'Li' our list items, I get a lot

03:32.520 --> 03:38.910
but it looks like I only get the first one the notebook. What if I wanted to select all of them? And

03:38.910 --> 03:44.170
that is because queries selector selects the first item that it finds.

03:44.230 --> 03:51.490
If I do querySelectorAll on the other hand it selects all of them.

03:54.520 --> 03:58.360
And you see over here that we get all the six 'Li' elements.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.770
Just to show you that it works with any CSS selectors.

04:06.820 --> 04:13.140
If I do 'Li' and H1 while I get the H1 and all the 'Li' as well.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.920
So it's very very useful.

04:14.920 --> 04:20.650
The one caveat as you know by now is that whenever a new features introduced we've got a way for all

04:20.650 --> 04:22.230
the browsers to implement it.

04:22.360 --> 04:22.950
So let's check.

04:22.950 --> 04:28.840
Can I use to see if querySelector is in good standing.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.290
All right.

04:29.290 --> 04:32.560
It looks like all the browsers have implemented it, which is good.

04:32.590 --> 04:34.650
Let's check querySelectorAll.

04:34.860 --> 04:37.660
All right we get the go ahead everything's green.

04:38.200 --> 04:38.880
That's good.

04:39.070 --> 04:45.670
I want to get used to that practice of making sure that whatever methods or properties you use both

04:45.670 --> 04:56.280
for HTML, CSS and Javascript everything is working in the browsers. So I recommend that you use these

04:56.280 --> 05:00.470
two to do your selection because it's exactly like CSS.

05:00.600 --> 05:06.120
They're more powerful than the first three. But you will encounter these three every once in a while

05:06.120 --> 05:07.500
with the older code bases.

05:08.800 --> 05:09.470
OK.

05:09.830 --> 05:10.550
What else can we do.

05:10.540 --> 05:15.260
I can see that we have Get attribute and Set attribute. Let's check it out.

05:16.980 --> 05:26.850
As the name suggests if I do document.getAttribute well, we see that there's nothing on the Get attribute

05:26.970 --> 05:33.270
is there? Because you need to select an element in order to get its attributes.

05:33.270 --> 05:34.140
Let me explain.

05:34.380 --> 05:42.960
So if I wanted to get the random 23 number from the first 'Li' well, I would first have select it, we can

05:42.960 --> 05:49.210
use something like querySelector and since I select the first one.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.930
I can say 'Li'

05:54.190 --> 05:59.650
and I get it. But remember we have to store it somewhere, so I could either give it to a variable and

05:59.650 --> 06:07.970
store it somewhere or I can just directly say getAttribute random.

06:08.090 --> 06:15.190
So I'll say I'll select the 'Li' and from there I'm going to get whatever attribute that is called 'random'

06:16.500 --> 06:18.650
and then I get 23.

06:18.870 --> 06:25.470
So getAttribute can be anything. You can picture an image tag that has width and height and you want

06:25.470 --> 06:30.970
to grab the maybe the width and height to see what values they have, what you can do with them.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.280
You can also set the attribute.

06:33.510 --> 06:44.970
So if I press up and I get the last command I can now change getAttribute to setAttribute to now say

06:45.000 --> 06:50.560
random which is the attribute that we want to grab and what we want to change it to.

06:50.880 --> 06:59.170
We can say we want to change it to 1000. Close the bracket and I get Undefined.

06:59.410 --> 07:09.780
But now if I select the querySelector the first 'Li' I see that random has now been changed to a 1000.

07:09.790 --> 07:12.970
Now you might be thinking to yourself with this.

07:13.060 --> 07:18.910
Can I have a class to maybe have a new style and change some

07:18.910 --> 07:22.160
CSS? What! You absolutely can.

07:22.270 --> 07:30.300
That's one of the cool things with having the DOM is that you can change anything in your Web browser.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.960
So let's try a few of those.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.830
You can use getAttribute or setAttribute

07:35.850 --> 07:39.470
But I want to show you the more common way of doing this.

07:39.510 --> 07:46.480
The first way of changing your style is simply using the style tag.

07:46.620 --> 07:58.020
So for example if I wanted to say querySelector, whoops I want to say document.querySelector and

07:58.080 --> 08:07.590
we'll select the H1 tag, this H1 also has a style property and all elements on the Web page have a

08:07.590 --> 08:08.380
style property.

08:10.120 --> 08:14.230
And here is a whole bunch of stuff that we don't need to worry about.

08:14.440 --> 08:21.040
But what we can do is say style and then dot, we want to access a property on the style which is, well,

08:21.620 --> 08:22.620
our CSS style.

08:22.630 --> 08:32.310
So we know that we can have background. So background we can say equals, but should we say will say background

08:32.340 --> 08:37.240
equals yellow, but it has to be a string right?

08:37.280 --> 08:41.960
So yellow string press Enter, look at that.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.000
We just change our background, and you can do styles like this and change all your styles.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.440
But there's one issue here.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.610
The issue is Separation of Concerns.

08:52.740 --> 09:03.060
We ideally don't want to include styles which what we've done is essentially style equals background

09:03.650 --> 09:04.660
yellow.

09:04.890 --> 09:07.160
It's the exact same thing that we've done.

09:07.410 --> 09:16.070
So if I refresh here you'll see that even though I haven't changed anything I still have the yellow background.

09:16.210 --> 09:26.650
But as we remember we wanna have that separation of HTML focuses on the text, CSS focuses on the style

09:26.980 --> 09:29.920
and Javascript on the actions.

09:30.020 --> 09:36.000
So what's a better way for us to do change styles than style.{property}.

09:36.060 --> 09:38.250
We have a few things that we can use.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.610
So we'll start off with className and classList.

09:40.650 --> 09:43.900
And I actually have a pretty cool style called cool title.

09:44.010 --> 09:45.110
So let's check that out.

09:46.230 --> 09:50.750
I want to remove this. Refresh.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.990
So let's put the document querySelector

09:58.350 --> 10:01.780
H1 in a variable so we don't have to keep doing this.

10:02.010 --> 10:06.060
So I'm going to say variable H1 equals

10:06.110 --> 10:06.580
There you go.

10:06.660 --> 10:13.440
So now we have H1. We can say H1 dot className

10:13.500 --> 10:18.610
equals and we'll add cool title.

10:18.830 --> 10:19.710
Let's see what happens.

10:20.860 --> 10:21.530
Whoa.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.320
That's pretty cool right.

10:23.420 --> 10:29.990
In case you're wondering how I did this will I just use this CSS and the way that I found it is I looked

10:29.990 --> 10:31.760
at this Codepen.

10:31.790 --> 10:37.290
So if you search codepen.io you can find a ton of cool things that people have built with

10:37.630 --> 10:41.770
CSS and you can see that this was done by Rafael Castro.

10:41.900 --> 10:46.630
I just used his cool CSS for my H1 tag.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.220
And there you go.

10:48.240 --> 10:58.570
So I've added a new class to my H1. If I select my H1 you see that I have a class called Title.

10:58.650 --> 11:00.810
Very nice.

11:00.850 --> 11:02.770
There's actually another thing we can do, we can do

11:02.770 --> 11:04.240
classList.

11:04.660 --> 11:15.800
So let's say that I wanted to add a class to 'Li' will say document.querySelector

11:18.640 --> 11:28.960
will do 'Li' which will select the first one and I want to say that here we want to look at ClassList.

11:29.060 --> 11:29.600
I see that

11:29.620 --> 11:33.240
well there's nothing because there's no classes.

11:33.560 --> 11:39.970
But if I add a class here and let's do bold, red

11:40.460 --> 11:43.120
and we don't need that comma.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.530
So now we have two class items.

11:45.590 --> 11:50.640
If I save and redo this and refresh

11:53.590 --> 12:01.990
I see that I have a list of classes. This class list gives us a few methods that we can use such as Add

12:02.380 --> 12:04.090
Remove and Toggle.

12:04.210 --> 12:05.060
So let's do that.

12:05.230 --> 12:07.720
Let's do the 'Li'.

12:07.730 --> 12:15.900
And I'm going to say classList.add and we'll add cool title.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.100
Look at that. That kind of messes up our list.

12:19.100 --> 12:22.520
So let's remove that cool title and add a different one.

12:22.580 --> 12:24.710
So I'm going to say classList

12:24.710 --> 12:25.480
Remove.

12:25.700 --> 12:37.990
Cool title and instead let's add another class that I have in my CSS which is called Done that will

12:37.990 --> 12:43.290
give me a line through the text, so that the To Do item is done.

12:43.630 --> 12:53.990
So if I do done, look at that, I have my first task on my shopping list done.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.880
But what if I made a mistake and I want to toggle it back.

12:57.960 --> 13:08.020
Instead of removing I could just say toggle, and toggle again and toggle and toggle and toggle. You see

13:08.020 --> 13:15.670
that this might be quite useful if you want to turn something on off on off back and forth.

13:15.700 --> 13:16.410
Very cool.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.050
What else do we have?

13:18.220 --> 13:26.430
What so far we've learned that we should use querySelectors to grab the element and change the styles

13:26.790 --> 13:29.200
using something like classList.

13:29.460 --> 13:33.250
Let's make sure that classList is available in all browsers.

13:34.120 --> 13:34.660
Let's check.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.340
ClassList.

13:38.760 --> 13:44.410
And it looks like we're getting green but there's a few such as IE 11 and that has partial support.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.430
So we want to be careful with using classLists.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.630
So we might have to use some text in some areas.

13:52.360 --> 13:55.640
I have a few more that I would like to show you.

13:55.690 --> 14:00.230
One is innerHTML and I have here dangerous.

14:00.310 --> 14:04.130
You'll see and then some code bases and this is why I want to show you this property.

14:04.510 --> 14:16.410
I can do something along the lines of document dot Selector H1.

14:16.480 --> 14:30.960
Now within this I can say innerHTML equals watch this strong exclamation marks and then close the strong tag.

14:31.070 --> 14:34.110
Now if I press Enter, look at that.

14:34.510 --> 14:42.380
I've just changed the innerHTML of H1 to have strong tag. Let's double-check what H1 looks like now.

14:43.220 --> 14:47.020
H1 has strong tags with exclamation marks.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.350
Let's go back.

14:48.380 --> 14:52.050
We can also access something called parentElement and children.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.420
So let's check that out.

14:54.230 --> 15:07.470
If I want to select Jello document dot querySelectorAll 'Li' will select Jello which is the second

15:08.930 --> 15:10.650
in the array so that means one.

15:11.300 --> 15:12.480
And I have Jello.

15:12.890 --> 15:25.260
So now I can say dot parentElement and I get the unordered list and if I do the parentElement of

15:25.740 --> 15:29.840
the parentElement I get the body.

15:29.870 --> 15:31.490
So I have Jello.

15:31.940 --> 15:38.400
I get the parent which is the UL and the parent of parent which is the body.

15:38.420 --> 15:42.570
I can also do children.

15:42.980 --> 15:50.360
So if I do this which is parent parent which goes to body and then children I get all the children of

15:50.360 --> 15:51.710
the body.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.940
Very cool.

15:52.940 --> 15:59.550
The last point I want to show you is that it is really important to Cache Selectors and Variables.

15:59.630 --> 16:00.490
What does that mean?

16:00.710 --> 16:04.480
Every time we do something like this let's say we had a Javascript file.

16:04.610 --> 16:10.370
And every time we're selecting new things whenever we want to use it.

16:11.530 --> 16:22.000
Well this is using up memory because the computer has to remember the browser has to remember that we

16:22.000 --> 16:26.890
want to select this and then we're selecting it again and then we're selecting again and we're selecting

16:26.890 --> 16:27.810
the same thing.

16:27.810 --> 16:37.390
So the Web browser is doing actions over and over when all we had to do was variable H1 equals document

16:37.920 --> 16:40.380
dot querySelector H1.

16:40.690 --> 16:48.610
So now any time I need to use H1 the Web browser doesn't have to go look up the DOM find H1 and then

16:48.610 --> 16:49.830
store it in memory.

16:49.900 --> 16:57.010
We have H1 living until we refresh the page so that the Web browsers work is done.

16:57.070 --> 17:00.650
It already told us where H1 is and now we can use it.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.360
And that's called Cache Selectors.

17:02.380 --> 17:03.880
And it's something that we'll cover.

17:04.090 --> 17:10.480
And the last video in this section where we talk about some developer fundamentals. I'll see you in the next

17:10.480 --> 17:11.830
video, bye bye.
