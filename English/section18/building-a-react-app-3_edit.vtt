WEBVTT

00:00.570 --> 00:05.760
All right we're getting closer and closer to having our app look like this but we clearly see that we

00:05.760 --> 00:07.820
have a search box here.

00:07.980 --> 00:14.450
So in this video we're going to work on having this interactive. Looking back at our app,

00:14.460 --> 00:15.170
we see that

00:15.180 --> 00:21.280
well we definitely need a title and the search box, so let's create that.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.830
If I go to index.js

00:23.030 --> 00:29.730
I think now that we're officially building an app, instead of having the "Cardlist" component here we should

00:29.730 --> 00:39.390
have one big component called "App", and this "App" will be the father of all our children, all our components

00:39.900 --> 00:42.890
Let's do that. Let's build the "App" component first

00:47.270 --> 00:53.060
And this "App" component again will "import React from 'react';"

00:57.620 --> 01:00.470
and "App" will equal

01:06.800 --> 01:13.130
the "CardList" component which we can just copy and put in here

01:15.560 --> 01:20.840
And again, changing this to "Babel", we want to import

01:23.850 --> 01:25.740
the "CardList" component

01:30.450 --> 01:37.500
and we also want to have our "robots" actually imported in here

01:37.540 --> 01:40.040
so we have access to it

01:40.150 --> 01:46.120
And then finally we now just want to render the app component so we can just bring this back the way

01:46.120 --> 01:48.490
it was

01:48.720 --> 01:54.030
We save. We need to obviously export our app

01:54.050 --> 02:02.960
So we'll say "export default App;", save this

02:03.170 --> 02:04.190
Let's go back

02:04.430 --> 02:04.700
Yep

02:04.760 --> 02:06.460
Everything is still working

02:07.060 --> 02:11.400
Now within the "CardList" we also have a header

02:11.470 --> 02:14.700
So we'll do "h1", that'll say "RoboFriends"

02:17.990 --> 02:22.850
and again remember that we need to return just one single parent

02:22.850 --> 02:27.110
ao we need to do something like a "div" to wrap it

02:31.560 --> 02:33.860
and I need to close this "h1" tag

02:37.250 --> 02:37.680
All right

02:37.690 --> 02:46.060
I have my "robot friends" title and we also need a search box. And although "h1" was easy and we now have to

02:46.060 --> 02:48.160
build a component for it,

02:48.160 --> 02:56.700
It sounds like we probably want to create a search box component for this app, so let's do that

02:56.700 --> 03:08.840
I'm going to say "import SearchBox" from a file that we'll create called "SearchBox". We will create a new

03:08.840 --> 03:09.200
file

03:19.810 --> 03:25.840
and this file will have "import React from 'react';"

03:29.030 --> 03:30.370
and the search box

03:32.570 --> 03:36.120
will have a function that returns -

03:36.140 --> 03:38.130
Let's think about what it returns

03:39.400 --> 03:43.830
Well it definitely returns an input, right?

03:43.870 --> 03:47.930
That is type of 'search'

03:48.210 --> 03:51.490
And let's also have a placeholder -

03:51.620 --> 04:02.740
let's close this - and placeholder that says 'search robots'

04:02.880 --> 04:15.080
We close this and save and we have to export: "export default SearchBox;", save, "Compiled successfully!"

04:15.080 --> 04:16.850
All right! We have our search box

04:16.850 --> 04:19.220
But, well, it's not searching anything right now

04:22.690 --> 04:29.130
Let's add this on a new line, just so it looks nicer. And it's always a good idea, just in case you want

04:29.130 --> 04:35.620
to add more things to the search box, to wrap everything in a "div"

04:35.670 --> 04:37.250
So I'm going to do that right now.

04:39.660 --> 04:44.070
And this "div" will just have a "className" of "padding2"

04:44.100 --> 04:50.180
again using [tag-ons], and with the "input" we can do a "className"

04:51.450 --> 04:52.920
and I just know these look good

04:52.920 --> 04:55.440
so I'm just going to copy and paste here

04:55.460 --> 04:56.860
just padding

04:56.970 --> 05:00.240
with background "lightest-blue"

05:00.240 --> 05:02.930
If I do this, and - let's go back

05:02.940 --> 05:03.600
All right

05:03.600 --> 05:04.800
This looks better -

05:04.830 --> 05:06.390
We want to center everything

05:06.540 --> 05:10.190
So maybe in the app we can just add a "className"

05:11.220 --> 05:14.570
equals to "text center"

05:14.580 --> 05:15.750
see if that works

05:17.010 --> 05:17.660
There you go

05:17.730 --> 05:19.370
That's much better

05:19.380 --> 05:21.380
I like this already

05:21.550 --> 05:25.610
Now, how can we make this interactive?

05:25.660 --> 05:33.600
Up until now we've just had these static web sites but real web sites are interactive, right?

05:33.660 --> 05:36.430
Well let's think about this logically

05:36.570 --> 05:39.360
We have an app

05:39.600 --> 05:41.920
We have a "SearchBox"

05:42.910 --> 05:53.220
And we have a "CardList", but the search box component needs to communicate with the card list, and same

05:53.220 --> 05:54.930
with the card list. "CardList"

05:54.960 --> 06:02.410
needs to know what is in the search box so that it can filter out robots accordingly

06:03.880 --> 06:10.030
Let's go back to our image that we have of one way data flow. Looking at this

06:10.030 --> 06:20.430
we have the app component, and then the card list component that has cards, and then the search box component

06:20.910 --> 06:22.790
that, well, doesn't have any children now

06:22.920 --> 06:30.030
But in order for these two to communicate we have a one way data flow, that is they need to send their

06:30.030 --> 06:36.170
information to their parent and the parent tells them what to do

06:37.230 --> 06:39.010
Now how can we do that

06:40.300 --> 06:46.870
Up until now we just had some data that we just trickled down, but we never had it where one of the children

06:47.020 --> 06:51.910
had to modify data or communicate with a neighbor.

06:54.650 --> 06:56.740
Well, in order to do this

06:56.740 --> 07:06.730
React has an idea of something called "state". Up until now we learned about props such as properties

07:06.730 --> 07:09.080
that we keep passing down

07:09.860 --> 07:15.150
but we've never changed them because React just reads the props.

07:15.170 --> 07:24.130
If I go to "CardList" it just reads the props that it receives and it just renders something. And this one-

07:24.130 --> 07:33.340
way data flow is really nice because this "CardList" is a pure function. It receives an input and then

07:33.400 --> 07:37.370
it always returns the same output

07:37.660 --> 07:42.760
So if robots are always the same it's always going to return the same thing

07:42.820 --> 07:48.430
It's deterministic, pure functions, and it's something that we've talked about before. And this is a really

07:48.430 --> 07:49.720
really good thing.

07:49.810 --> 07:56.200
These components are what's called "pure components", and some even call it "dumb components"

07:56.200 --> 08:01.480
It just means that they don't really need to know about anything other than the fact that they're pure

08:01.480 --> 08:04.680
functions that receive something and return something.

08:05.200 --> 08:11.480
And this is really nice because we always know what this is going to look like, and that's all we had

08:11.540 --> 08:12.870
up until this point

08:13.250 --> 08:18.640
But now we have to worry about something other than props

08:18.740 --> 08:22.840
Props never change. Props are always just inputs that we get

08:22.850 --> 08:24.370
and we've never modified them

08:25.180 --> 08:29.490
But in this case we need a memory in our app

08:29.680 --> 08:36.150
We need this to communicate with this, and also change and update accordingly

08:36.340 --> 08:44.380
And that's what "state" is in React. "State" - and you'll hear this in computer programming a lot - simply means

08:45.340 --> 08:54.060
the description of your app. A "state" is simply an object - an object that describes your application

08:54.430 --> 09:02.650
And this "state" which describes our application is the robots, and whatever's entered in the search box

09:04.110 --> 09:07.020
and "state" is able to change

09:07.110 --> 09:13.020
We're able to change the value of the search box, the value of the input, and we're able to change what

09:13.060 --> 09:15.190
robot's array means

09:15.210 --> 09:17.190
What gets displayed

09:17.290 --> 09:19.390
This is a rule that you just have to remember

09:19.570 --> 09:26.330
Props are simply things that come out of "state"

09:26.440 --> 09:34.570
So a parent feeds "state" into a child component and as soon as a child (components) component receives a

09:34.580 --> 09:42.460
"state" it's a property. That child can never change that property. The parent just tells it what the "state"

09:42.460 --> 09:47.630
is and the child receives it as "robots"

09:47.650 --> 09:58.090
So the first thing we need to do is to start being able to use "state" in our app, the description of what

09:58.600 --> 10:00.650
our "state" should be

10:00.670 --> 10:07.960
So let's just do a constant "state" for now and show you that our "state" needs to have a "robots" array

10:08.410 --> 10:14.360
and it needs to have, let's call it "searchfield"

10:14.610 --> 10:18.530
And this is just whatever our search field needs

10:18.840 --> 10:25.500
But in order to use "state" we have to go back to our original way that we created React components. If

10:25.500 --> 10:37.990
you remember this, when we first did "create React app", we create a class and we do that by saying "export

10:38.380 --> 10:40.420
default" or "export App

10:46.710 --> 10:51.540
extends React.Component"

10:51.670 --> 11:02.640
It extends the "Component" class, and again we can use shorthand here and just say… So now we can just remove

11:02.640 --> 11:03.630
React from here

11:04.510 --> 11:14.830
And this always has a render function that has to return something, which is this

11:18.990 --> 11:28.750
Again, it's just the syntax that you have to get used to. So if I save this - oh, and I made a mistake here, instead

11:28.750 --> 11:30.580
of "export" this should say "class"

11:30.790 --> 11:36.720
So, yeah, "class App extends Component" and then we do "export default App;"

11:36.730 --> 11:43.750
So again we're just declaring a class. I save and we just have something that says "state is assigned

11:43.750 --> 11:46.590
a value but never used"

11:46.740 --> 11:48.270
That's because that's pretty true

11:48.270 --> 11:49.150
we don't use it

11:49.200 --> 11:53.000
So how can we add "state"? Well, in React

11:53.010 --> 11:56.030
we simply do a constructor

11:56.040 --> 11:58.600
You might remember this from when we spoke about objects

11:59.630 --> 12:05.130
And this constructor, in here we can declare the state

12:05.330 --> 12:21.400
We simply say "this.state =", and in here we just put whatever we want our state to have

12:21.400 --> 12:24.630
So if I save this, I get

12:24.700 --> 12:27.610
"'this' is not allowed before super()"

12:27.610 --> 12:34.010
Again, something that you might remember from the advanced objects video in order to use "this"

12:34.300 --> 12:42.890
we have to do this weird thing where we call "super()" which calls the constructor of component

12:43.090 --> 12:49.890
If I do this and save, everything's working fine

12:49.960 --> 13:00.810
And now we have our "state", which is robots and search field, and this "state" as I've said before is what

13:00.810 --> 13:02.220
describes our app

13:02.220 --> 13:07.590
These are the things that can change, and that's what this "state" is - something that can change and affect

13:07.860 --> 13:08.720
our app

13:10.320 --> 13:17.160
And they usually live in the parent component, the component that is the parent that just kind of passes

13:17.180 --> 13:19.550
"state" to different components

13:19.550 --> 13:29.210
And now I can access "robots", not from here, but from "this.state.robots"

13:29.310 --> 13:34.100
And again, just React syntax that you'll have to get used to

13:34.270 --> 13:34.540
All right

13:34.550 --> 13:37.180
So everything is working as expected

13:37.490 --> 13:47.210
And do you see that our state, which is "robots", is now passed down as "props" so "CardList" accepts "robots"

13:47.330 --> 13:50.550
as "props" even though in the app.js 

13:50.690 --> 13:59.090
it's a "state". And like I said because "App" now owns "state" that includes "robots"

13:59.180 --> 14:02.540
it's allowed to change it. OK

14:02.630 --> 14:11.530
Now the way we can communicate them, we have these two valleys, and ideally in the search box I have something

14:11.530 --> 14:19.930
called "onSearchChange()", which again is a function that I'm just going to make up

14:20.500 --> 14:23.170
This is just a random name that I've created

14:23.650 --> 14:30.250
And "onSearchChange()" I want to say that every time the input changes, just like we did with DOM manipulation,

14:30.670 --> 14:37.580
we get an event, and within this event I'm going to "console.log" this event

14:41.430 --> 14:44.590
I've created a function, and I want

14:44.590 --> 14:48.740
any time this input changes to trigger "console.log"

14:49.170 --> 14:58.890
So we can pass this actually now. I can say "searchChange=[onSearchChange]", but again because this

14:58.890 --> 15:09.090
is an object we have to say "this." so that it says "this" (which is the "App") ".onSearchChange" is "searchChange"

15:10.110 --> 15:17.760
If I save this and now go to the search box, I now have "searchChange"

15:21.590 --> 15:25.910
as a function, so I can just say, just like in HTML -

15:25.930 --> 15:32.110
Remember in HTML I can do "onchange html", it's an event,

15:32.170 --> 15:36.040
we're just listening to "any time the input changes"

15:36.260 --> 15:39.720
So I can say "onChange="

15:42.420 --> 15:43.980
"[searchChange]"

15:43.980 --> 15:45.600
Let's see if that works

15:45.690 --> 15:46.730
I'm getting no errors

15:46.740 --> 15:53.290
If I go back to my app, I open up the console and I type in something, and look at that!

15:53.340 --> 16:01.120
I'm getting the event. And this is just something you have to remember is that with an event we always

16:01.120 --> 16:09.170
have "event.target.value" which should give us the value of the search term

16:09.190 --> 16:13.580
Let's save that and type in something here

16:15.160 --> 16:19.960
Look at that! We're now noticing the difference as we type

16:20.000 --> 16:22.760
So let's go over one more time what just happened

16:23.650 --> 16:25.640
And again I know this is tough

16:25.660 --> 16:31.170
This took me a while to get when we first started, but this diagram really explains it well

16:32.080 --> 16:34.180
I have my app component

16:34.180 --> 16:43.940
My search box, and my card list. Any time the search box changes, on change I'm going to run the function, I'm

16:43.940 --> 16:48.620
going to call this function

16:48.630 --> 16:51.020
And the way we call it is we add this

16:51.100 --> 16:58.240
Remember how when we did DOM events we defined the function and then every time the event happens it

16:58.240 --> 16:59.490
would call it.

16:59.920 --> 17:08.720
So we are saying every time the onchange event is triggered, call the search change function

17:08.950 --> 17:16.330
And if you remember the search change function which is a prop is the "onSearchChange" function that

17:16.330 --> 17:17.460
is defined in the app

17:17.470 --> 17:19.470
That's how we communicate with the parent

17:19.510 --> 17:24.880
It triggers the event, the parent says "Oh, run this function"

17:25.060 --> 17:29.810
And now this function gets run

17:29.940 --> 17:39.150
But now that I have the value of the search input, I can now directly communicate that search input to

17:39.330 --> 17:41.110
the "robots" list

17:41.130 --> 17:42.660
Let's see how that works

17:42.720 --> 17:55.950
We can create a variable, let's say "filteredRobots", and this will equal the "this.state.robots"

17:57.980 --> 18:00.190
and this "robots", which is the array

18:00.230 --> 18:08.240
- again this is how we access "state" - is going to use "filter", filtering our array

18:08.410 --> 18:17.290
We give it "robots", and now our array will have to return a condition, and the condition is going to be

18:18.820 --> 18:19.530
"robots"

18:19.560 --> 18:28.400
".name" and we're going to do something that we haven't seen before which is "to.LowerCase"

18:28.720 --> 18:33.850
And this is a method that comes with all strings, and it just makes everything lowercase

18:33.880 --> 18:39.840
And this is good for comparisons so we don't have to compare capitalized or lowercase

18:39.990 --> 18:51.640
And if the "name" of "robots", which is now lowercased, "includes" - it's another method and again it's pre-built

18:51.700 --> 18:58.450
into javascript - if it "includes" the "searchfield"

18:58.610 --> 19:02.940
And again we want to do "toLowerCase" in case

19:03.140 --> 19:08.140
Well in case we use capitals or lowercase, it works both ways

19:08.510 --> 19:09.260
And there it is

19:09.470 --> 19:16.370
If the name of the robots in lowercase includes - and this does the comparison -

19:16.530 --> 19:26.400
if anything in the string includes "toLowerCase", well, then only return the robots that returns true

19:26.400 --> 19:29.220
to this. Let's save -

19:29.270 --> 19:33.240
- oh, and you see here the how you get the 'searchfield' there because, well, it's part of the state

19:33.260 --> 19:38.190
I have to do "this.state.searchfield"

19:38.400 --> 19:42.150
If I save this, I get that

19:42.150 --> 19:44.720
"'filteredRobots' is assigned a value but never used"

19:44.850 --> 19:49.240
But don't worry, we can now console log this and see what we get

19:51.320 --> 19:59.970
if I save, and let's go back to our app, and if I search something here, oh, I get an error

20:00.110 --> 20:03.510
And this is an error that is very very confusing

20:03.530 --> 20:05.010
It is tricky the first time

20:05.120 --> 20:06.490
But bear with me here

20:06.620 --> 20:11.700
The problem right now is that the value of "this"

20:12.260 --> 20:23.090
well it's not referring to the "App", because the event happened in the "input", the value of "this" is, well,

20:23.090 --> 20:28.040
the input, and "input" doesn't have "state.robots"

20:28.490 --> 20:35.050
And this is a trick that you always forget, but just keep this in mind as a rule of thumb

20:36.060 --> 20:43.740
With anything that comes from React, so constructor and render are pre-built in React, any time you

20:43.740 --> 20:54.100
make your own methods on a component, use this syntax, so arrow functions, and this makes sure that the "this"

20:54.100 --> 20:58.020
value is according to where it was created, which is the "App"

20:58.210 --> 20:59.320
I know it's confusing

20:59.320 --> 21:00.610
You can up read more about it

21:00.610 --> 21:02.280
I'll leave a resource for it

21:02.290 --> 21:06.280
It's a tough topic to get, but again, rule of thumb -

21:06.280 --> 21:07.260
use the arrows

21:07.300 --> 21:16.550
If I do this now and I click, there you go - I now get "robots"

21:16.600 --> 21:18.250
But here's the thing

21:18.250 --> 21:24.610
Searchfield right now - you see that I still have 10 robots, it's not really filtering anything

21:24.880 --> 21:31.570
And that is because my "searchfield" is always an empty string. In order to update the state

21:31.660 --> 21:40.890
again another rule of React is to do "this.setState", and it's again a method that comes with React

21:40.900 --> 21:47.680
And anytime you want to change state you always do this, you don't do "this.state.searchfield ="

21:47.770 --> 21:49.290
- you never do that

21:49.300 --> 22:00.280
You have to do "this.setState", and within here we just say "searchfield is…" - and again we're using

22:00.280 --> 22:06.460
an object, so "searchfield is now going to be "event.target.value"

22:08.480 --> 22:20.870
If I save this and go back, you see that now everything is being filtered

22:20.930 --> 22:26.130
So I'm changing the state so that the "searchfield" always gets updated

22:26.150 --> 22:30.770
and now we're filtering the robots according to the changed "searchfield"

22:33.330 --> 22:33.620
OK

22:33.640 --> 22:37.320
So one last thing. Looking at this

22:37.570 --> 22:42.250
We have the fact that filter robots is still not assigned, and you're right

22:42.400 --> 22:48.400
If we look at this, we've now communicated the search box with the app, and we have the search field constantly

22:48.400 --> 22:48.940
changing

22:48.940 --> 22:56.740
So now we need to communicate it to the "filteredRobots". What we can do is that "filteredRobots" can now

22:56.740 --> 23:02.350
be used as props instead of "this.state.robots"

23:02.350 --> 23:03.100
So let's do that

23:03.160 --> 23:06.910
Let's move this down here

23:10.430 --> 23:17.060
And now we have access to "filteredRobots", and instead of passing "this.state.robots" we simply pass

23:17.690 --> 23:19.970
"filteredRobots"

23:20.120 --> 23:23.670
If I save this, make sure the search part saved as well

23:23.930 --> 23:29.940
And now I go back. I'm going to close the tab and let's check it out

23:33.200 --> 23:34.280
Look at that

23:34.430 --> 23:37.420
We have our app working

23:37.610 --> 23:38.610
How cool is that

23:39.960 --> 23:43.230
Let's go over it one more time to show you exactly what it does

23:45.150 --> 23:52.110
We have our "App" component that has two states - "robots" and "searchfield"

23:52.300 --> 24:01.120
And because "App" owns the state, any component that has "state" uses the "class" syntax so they can use the

24:01.150 --> 24:08.930
"constructor" function to create "this.state", and this "state" is what changes in an app

24:08.950 --> 24:11.380
It's what describes the app

24:11.380 --> 24:16.840
Remember when I said the virtual DOM is just a javascript object? The virtual DOM is just an object that

24:16.840 --> 24:27.190
collects this entire state and React uses this state to render and pass them down as props to these

24:27.190 --> 24:32.740
components so that these components that are just pure functions can just render

24:32.940 --> 24:38.010
And we always know that the app is going to look the same because, well, they're just simple pure functions

24:39.350 --> 24:44.500
We manage this state in here, the app is the only thing that can change this state

24:44.630 --> 24:52.880
But it can pass down things such as props, so we passed down "onSearchChange" to the "SearchBox", and the

24:52.880 --> 24:56.720
"SearchBox", every time there's an "onChange" on the input,

24:56.720 --> 24:59.760
it lets the app know "Hey, there was a change"

24:59.840 --> 25:00.840
"Run this function"

25:01.040 --> 25:07.570
It runs the function with the event and updates the state of the "searchfield" to whatever we type

25:09.600 --> 25:15.720
Now with the information that we have from the search box we can now communicate to the card list and

25:15.720 --> 25:26.100
tell it "Hey, I want to filter the "robots" state to now have only what includes in the "searchfield"

25:27.030 --> 25:34.970
and instead of passing that "this.state" to our "robots" we just passed the "filteredRobots"

25:35.130 --> 25:39.000
You might be asking yourself "Well, "robots" never really changes, does it?"

25:39.000 --> 25:43.620
"We always just create a new array called "filterRobots" and we always pass that down"

25:43.680 --> 25:46.540
"Does this need to be part of the state"

25:47.020 --> 25:53.550
And right now not really because we just have a hard coded "robots", but when we get later on in the

25:53.550 --> 25:56.080
course you'll see that that's not the case

25:56.220 --> 26:02.550
Most of the time you're getting the users or robots from another place over the internet in which

26:02.550 --> 26:08.610
case we will need "robots" to change from an empty array to an array

26:08.610 --> 26:14.480
after we go and grab all of our users

26:14.750 --> 26:15.410
Whoo! All right

26:15.530 --> 26:16.850
That was a lot

26:16.880 --> 26:23.000
I know, I know it's a lot of information, a lot of new syntax, but as you can see, with a few lines of

26:23.000 --> 26:30.320
code we built a pretty awesome app. In the next video we're going to finish this up and finalize our

26:30.320 --> 26:30.660
app

26:30.680 --> 26:33.490
so it looks as pretty as this

26:33.560 --> 26:35.130
I'll see you in that one. Bye!
