00:00.750 --> 00:05.650
And a welcome back. We know how the RoboFriends app works

00:05.660 --> 00:14.330
now, with react, that's great. But Bruno asked us a specific thing. We need to add redux to our 

00:14.330 --> 00:20.860
RoboFriends app so that it can scale well, and handle state management better.

00:22.630 --> 00:28.960
Now with these next videos were going to work together, step by step.

00:28.990 --> 00:34.630
I'm going to show you how redux is implemented and how it works and you're going to be following along

00:35.170 --> 00:38.320
trying to make sure that your code works as well.

00:38.770 --> 00:42.120
All right so take a pause now and get your environment set up.

00:42.140 --> 00:46.470
So you can code along with me. You're all set?

00:46.510 --> 00:46.940
All right.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.300
I'm going to get started.

00:48.370 --> 00:56.360
The first thing I'm going to do is, I have my RoboFriends app, so I'm going to clone this repo and

00:56.360 --> 01:06.650
we'll just do our regular set up with git clone and then I'm going to CD into my RoboFriend. Perfect.

01:06.690 --> 01:09.510
Let's open this up in your text editor.

01:14.630 --> 01:18.720
And again I love joining these together so it looks nice.

01:19.470 --> 01:20.670
And clean.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.250
Perfect.

01:22.670 --> 01:29.510
Now obviously the first thing we need to do when we clone something is npm install to make sure

01:29.510 --> 01:32.710
we have all the packages.

01:32.920 --> 01:38.970
And we also want to make sure that everything is running smoothly without any errors whatsoever.

01:39.190 --> 01:48.410
So the next step is going to be to run npm start.

01:48.460 --> 01:49.180
All right.

01:49.180 --> 01:49.690
Perfect.

01:49.690 --> 01:50.930
Everything is working.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.780
And we should be able to filter.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.420
Perfect.

01:56.430 --> 01:56.690
All right.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.790
So we're familiar with this codebase.

02:01.120 --> 02:09.990
We have our react app, but that's it. Just a simple react app with containers and components.

02:10.040 --> 02:20.930
The very first thing we would want to do is install redux. So I'm going to close this and run npm install redux.

02:23.740 --> 02:30.990
This redux package will give us some tools in order to incorporate redux into our react app.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.840
But here's the cool part.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.630
With the redux package, and why I'm such a big fan.

02:38.690 --> 02:45.680
It's that 90 percent of your code is still going to be Javascript. Redux is going to give you a few helpers

02:46.070 --> 02:48.620
but you're still writing Javascript.

02:48.740 --> 02:52.280
It's still improving your Javascript skills.

02:52.280 --> 02:57.470
When you write redux and it teaches really really good principles, which is why I'm such a big fan of

02:57.530 --> 03:05.630
the library. You might not always need redux in your projects but it is just a good, good tool to learn

03:05.960 --> 03:13.070
because it has such great concepts that you'll use throughout your career.

03:13.220 --> 03:19.010
Now the second thing we need, and this is something similar with react - remember how we installed the

03:19.010 --> 03:25.730
react package, and then we also needed something called the react dom package to connect react to

03:25.730 --> 03:29.130
the dom? Well, in similar fashion.

03:29.140 --> 03:38.770
We need to connect redux to react because redux theoretically could work with any other library by adding

03:38.980 --> 03:40.240
another package.

03:40.300 --> 03:46.600
We can again let react know that hey we're going to be using redux with you.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.050
So that's very easy to do.

03:48.070 --> 03:53.080
We'll just npm install and the package is called react redux.

03:59.260 --> 04:06.570
And the way this react redux is going to work is that it's going to connect only the containers.

04:06.760 --> 04:14.410
So in this case app.js to the, what we call a redux store or that big Javascript object we're talking

04:14.410 --> 04:14.820
about.

04:14.860 --> 04:21.110
That describes the state of our app and they're going to communicate, the container is going to communicate

04:21.200 --> 04:23.770
with the store and vice versa.

04:24.900 --> 04:31.410
Now the other components, what we call dumb or presentational components,

04:31.530 --> 04:34.250
won't know that redux exists.

04:34.320 --> 04:41.010
The only connection is going to be between something called a container or a smart component and the

04:41.100 --> 04:42.650
redux store.

04:42.660 --> 04:44.130
So let me show you what I mean.

04:45.280 --> 04:51.040
If you remember this diagram we just installed the redux package which you can think of it as being

04:51.040 --> 04:51.990
over here.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.300
This red box that allows us to create a store and a couple of other help functions.

04:58.300 --> 05:10.310
We also downloaded react redux which allows us to connect these two pieces and react redux is able

05:10.310 --> 05:17.090
to be used in order to say hey we want these yellow components to be aware that we're using redux and to

05:17.090 --> 05:20.650
get their state from the redux store.

05:22.380 --> 05:28.020
So just think of this diagram as we're working through it all we're doing is essentially connecting

05:28.020 --> 05:30.710
these two libraries together.

05:30.770 --> 05:37.630
All right so now that we have these two packages we can start importing them and using it within our

05:37.630 --> 05:43.660
app but that's for the next couple of videos. I'll see you in the next one.

05:43.770 --> 05:44.010
Bye-bye.
