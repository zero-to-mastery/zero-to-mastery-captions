00:00.620 --> 00:01.370
Welcome back.

00:02.230 --> 00:08.970
I've just put our robo friends project on GitHub but let's say you're downloading this project.

00:09.110 --> 00:15.950
Maybe you're sharing a project with other developers but this project let's say was written last year.

00:15.950 --> 00:21.500
How can we update this project if you remember when we look at the package.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.090
Dot Jason File.

00:23.090 --> 00:30.020
We have the react version as sixteen point two but the react version is now higher.

00:30.020 --> 00:35.750
So let's update this project as you would on any other project.

00:35.750 --> 00:39.670
I'm going to clone this repo and I'm going to use SS H.

00:39.710 --> 00:46.260
You might have to use HDP s if you haven't had that setup but I'm going to use SSA just so I don't have

00:46.260 --> 00:48.500
to enter my password every time.

00:48.750 --> 00:56.820
So I'm going to clone this repo say get clone robo friends awesome.

00:56.860 --> 01:03.600
Now if I go into my robo friends folder and I open this and sublime.

01:03.670 --> 01:05.120
There we go.

01:05.170 --> 01:09.620
We have our package dot Jason File which we can see over here.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.650
Now when I usually download a project I want to make sure it starts.

01:13.650 --> 01:20.990
So I'm going to say NPM start and make sure that everything is still working and I get an error because

01:20.990 --> 01:23.270
I have to first do npm install

01:27.910 --> 01:28.460
Oh boy.

01:28.600 --> 01:36.730
And we get a bunch of errors or warnings saying we've audited some of your packages and there's a few

01:36.730 --> 01:37.720
vulnerabilities.

01:37.780 --> 01:38.820
Actually quite a lot.

01:38.830 --> 01:49.170
And two critical one and we can run NPM audit fix to fix the so let's copy that and run that again

01:55.110 --> 02:01.130
and now I get another issue that twenty seven vulnerabilities required manual review.

02:01.740 --> 02:07.140
And you see here that it's mainly because some of them require what we call breaking changes it might

02:07.230 --> 02:08.850
break our app.

02:08.850 --> 02:16.660
And this is the tradeoff when updating libraries you are using an older version of a library that may

02:16.660 --> 02:24.470
have changed and now breaks your app completely so sometimes you want to go one by one to actually check

02:24.890 --> 02:28.670
and see what the changes are in these libraries.

02:28.670 --> 02:31.400
Now if I run NPM plot it here

02:35.160 --> 02:42.550
it'll actually give me some idea of what my issues are now.

02:42.690 --> 02:54.520
Before I do NPM audit fix and then do dash dash force to force all those changes I want to talk a little

02:54.520 --> 02:56.530
bit about this package that Jason

02:59.670 --> 03:07.800
you see the react scripts which is the create react app script that runs is outdated.

03:07.800 --> 03:14.800
There's a way higher version of React scripts a bigger version of the CIA create react.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.190
And same with react.

03:17.190 --> 03:26.540
So one thing I can do is say NPM update and if I run this and when I click on this file check this out

03:27.930 --> 03:29.060
did you see that.

03:29.340 --> 03:38.820
My version's got updated now and p.m. update what it does is it looks at this version and says What's

03:38.820 --> 03:44.790
the highest version that I can upgrade to in my case because I use that card.

03:44.790 --> 03:51.970
It said hey you can upgrade to whatever the highest version is in the minor release.

03:52.050 --> 03:59.960
So if there was a react version 17 well this wouldn't upgrade to 17 because we're using the carrot.

03:59.970 --> 04:10.150
Remember we can use greater than if we want to but this way we make sure that we only update whatever

04:10.150 --> 04:14.690
is in the minor release which tends to not have any breaking changes.

04:14.740 --> 04:19.610
For example when we have react 17 that's most likely going to have some breaking changes.

04:19.720 --> 04:19.960
Okay.

04:19.990 --> 04:29.120
So we have the react version updated but we still have these vulnerabilities that we need to fix let's

04:29.120 --> 04:36.680
now run the audit fix and force assuming that we've looked through the changes and we assume that it's

04:36.710 --> 04:38.990
ok everything should still work.

04:39.290 --> 04:45.080
So I'm going to run this and again keep in mind that when using force you want to make sure that you

04:45.080 --> 04:47.520
actually review the updates.

04:47.540 --> 04:53.290
Now while this is going another thing I could have done with react is actually gone to the react Web

04:53.310 --> 05:01.340
site and checked the actual version and instead of having that cared just or doing NPM update I could

05:01.430 --> 05:09.800
just change the version let's say version 17 comes out in react seventeen point zero point two.

05:09.890 --> 05:16.160
Well I can just change that and package that Jason and run npm install again

05:19.150 --> 05:21.370
let's clear this.

05:21.370 --> 05:28.310
We see here that our ReACT script is now updated to version three point two.

05:28.330 --> 05:31.460
That is the latest version of create react.

05:31.840 --> 05:32.850
That's awesome.

05:32.920 --> 05:40.020
If I do NPM audit once again I have zero vulnerabilities.

05:40.020 --> 05:40.470
All right.

05:40.470 --> 05:45.290
Looks like everything is looking fine but we have one issue right.

05:45.310 --> 05:48.540
We've updated everything that we have.

05:48.540 --> 05:57.770
There's no vulnerabilities but because we've updated all these things will our project still work while

05:57.770 --> 05:58.910
there's one way to find out.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.090
Let's do NPM start.

06:03.110 --> 06:03.770
All right.

06:03.800 --> 06:11.910
The new create react app asked me for a target browser so I'll click yes here and look at that.

06:11.920 --> 06:14.710
Looks like things are still working.

06:14.710 --> 06:16.090
Good job robo friends.

06:16.090 --> 06:21.460
If I open up the developer tools and I go to console there's no errors.

06:21.520 --> 06:30.570
That's great so just like that I was able to update my project upgrade my project with all the latest

06:31.320 --> 06:38.470
react all the latest react on the react scripts which is what create react app uses.

06:38.700 --> 06:43.860
We have TAC yarns updated as well and everything is working fine.

06:45.080 --> 06:50.810
So I can now push this change to get hub so that we don't have those security warnings.

06:50.810 --> 06:51.890
Let's do that.

06:51.890 --> 06:57.280
I'm going to say get ad get commit.

06:57.510 --> 07:07.590
I'll say fixing security issues updated libraries

07:10.400 --> 07:20.770
to get push origin master because while I'm the only one on this project so I can just push to Max sir.

07:20.930 --> 07:32.030
Now if I go back to my github page and I refresh let's check out the security tab and look at that we

07:32.030 --> 07:40.410
have zero closed zero open because our project is now fully up to date.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.380
How cool is that.

07:42.420 --> 07:49.590
This is a great way to keep your projects updated and the security vulnerabilities fixed.

07:49.890 --> 07:57.750
But the more libraries you have the more dependencies you have the more maintenance you have to do to

07:57.750 --> 08:04.380
make sure that every time you update a library that it doesn't break your app.

08:04.380 --> 08:10.920
Our robo friends app was fairly small but you can imagine this being a bigger and bigger issues as applications

08:10.980 --> 08:11.290
grow.

08:11.940 --> 08:17.550
But I hope you learned one little trick that took me a long time to actually learn and my developer

08:17.550 --> 08:18.300
career.

08:18.390 --> 08:26.400
That is the easiest way to keep your projects up to date and secure is to just simply update the package.

08:26.530 --> 08:27.690
On file.

08:27.930 --> 08:29.520
I'll see in the next one by.
