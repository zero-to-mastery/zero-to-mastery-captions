00:01.100 --> 00:02.210
Welcome back.

00:02.210 --> 00:08.780
Now that we have our actions constants and reducers, let's start connecting this redux part of our application

00:09.170 --> 00:11.540
to our react application.

00:13.290 --> 00:16.630
Now the way we can do that is quite simple.

00:17.520 --> 00:25.260
If you remember we downloaded a package called react redux and this package let's import it over here

00:26.910 --> 00:32.840
comes with nice and easy API of just two things.

00:32.920 --> 00:40.540
One is a provider and the other one is connect and using these two things we're going to be able to

00:40.780 --> 00:42.900
connect these two parts of our application.

00:43.570 --> 00:52.660
So I'm going to say import from react redux.

00:52.870 --> 00:58.520
Now in this video we're going to talk about the provider and in the next video talk about connect.

00:58.540 --> 01:04.560
So for now let's just have the provider importing.

01:04.780 --> 01:13.300
Now within here there's a few things we need to do first is to create the store. If we go back to our

01:13.300 --> 01:23.510
diagram we remember that there's something called a store and redox which is the source of all truth.

01:23.800 --> 01:32.530
That is it's a big object javascript, object that describes the state of our app so that react can render

01:32.530 --> 01:36.010
it make changes and display it to the user.

01:36.010 --> 01:43.330
So we've created an action we've created and reduce a reducer and we also need a store.

01:43.510 --> 01:45.900
So let's do that first.

01:46.020 --> 01:53.600
We can use the redux package for this and say import and it has a function called create store.

01:53.670 --> 01:54.920
Nice and easy name.

01:55.170 --> 02:00.620
And we're going to import that from the redux package.

02:00.660 --> 02:06.570
Now the way we create a store is quite easy and we can say const store equals

02:09.780 --> 02:19.940
create store and within here we put the, what we call a rootReducer, that is the reducer of our app

02:20.570 --> 02:22.390
Now in real life,

02:22.460 --> 02:25.420
we have many many reducers.

02:25.730 --> 02:34.230
If we go back to our reducer file, right now we only have one the search robots reducer.

02:34.430 --> 02:41.240
But as I said before applications get more and more complex and you're going to have more and more actions

02:41.360 --> 02:42.450
that need to be taken.

02:42.890 --> 02:50.420
And we can keep listing actions related to search robots right in here but later on in the video we

02:50.420 --> 02:54.840
also need to get robots from the API.

02:55.280 --> 03:05.870
If you remember. now because of that we're going to have many many many reducers and in the store we

03:05.870 --> 03:15.820
want to combine all these reducers to create one root reducer which we're going to do later on.

03:16.650 --> 03:25.080
But for now because we only have one reducer, let's just use the search robots reducer to create

03:25.080 --> 03:25.480
the store

03:29.650 --> 03:31.580
and we need to import this.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.880
So let's go ahead and do that.

03:33.680 --> 03:34.920
And I say import

03:38.010 --> 03:44.470
search robots from our reducer file.

03:44.480 --> 03:44.970
All right.

03:45.020 --> 03:51.930
So I have search robots here to create the store with and that's it.

03:51.950 --> 04:00.560
We have a store. Now this store can now be accessed and passed down into our app.

04:00.650 --> 04:08.110
Remember with redux hypothetically we can remove all state from our react up and keep it inside of

04:08.110 --> 04:11.850
the store and pass down the store as a prop.

04:11.890 --> 04:21.590
So let's see what happens if I do that if I go store equals to the store that we have and I save.

04:21.740 --> 04:24.460
And let's also open up app.js

04:25.360 --> 04:26.780
And in the

04:26.810 --> 04:27.690
componentDidMount.

04:27.890 --> 04:29.240
Let's just console log

04:32.000 --> 04:40.060
this.props.store

04:40.100 --> 04:41.460
All right let's run npm start

04:48.270 --> 04:49.630
When I open up the console

04:52.820 --> 04:57.800
and we have a bit of an narrow here that's just a syntax error in our case then statements so let's

04:57.800 --> 04:58.550
fix that.

05:01.540 --> 05:03.150
Go to reducers.

05:03.240 --> 05:09.420
We don't need the double quotes here for the semicolon here because we have it over here.

05:09.500 --> 05:17.770
Let's save that and we get an error saying that search field is not defined in our reducers file.

05:17.840 --> 05:20.720
And again a small little error here.

05:20.720 --> 05:30.370
The way we want to pass the third parameter to an object.assign is as an object so we want to go like

05:30.370 --> 05:31.020
this.

05:32.880 --> 05:39.790
And we to constant small little error here to save all right.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.950
So everything is working.

05:40.950 --> 05:46.700
We have a warning saying that provider is defined but never used that's fine.

05:47.570 --> 05:49.180
Because while we're not using yet.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.390
But let's go to console log and see what happens.

05:52.750 --> 06:01.570
All right we see that our store over here has logged out and we have a few functions that we can use

06:01.870 --> 06:05.860
including get state. Let's use that and see what happens.

06:05.890 --> 06:15.750
Again going to my index file I'm going to say or in our app.js file I'm going to say get state, going

06:15.760 --> 06:20.490
to save go back and look at that.

06:20.550 --> 06:27.190
We have our state which just has the search field right now.

06:27.190 --> 06:27.620
All right.

06:27.760 --> 06:36.910
So we're passing down our store as a prop and we can use get state. Very cool, let's remove this console

06:36.910 --> 06:37.750
log.

06:37.750 --> 06:43.120
Since we don't need it we understand what's going on now in the index file we need to pass down the

06:43.120 --> 06:45.820
store to the app.

06:45.920 --> 06:52.900
Now we don't really want to pass down the store all the way down our component tree to the smaller components

06:53.200 --> 07:01.170
over and over again and react redox gives us a nice component that we can use to do this very easily.

07:01.280 --> 07:06.770
We can simply wrap our app component in this provider component.

07:06.770 --> 07:07.770
Let me show you.

07:08.300 --> 07:24.180
We're going to have a provider component and this app component is going to be inside of it just like

07:24.180 --> 07:27.150
that.

07:27.160 --> 07:31.540
Now the formatting here is a little bit off but it's fine for now.

07:31.540 --> 07:39.220
I just wanna see that the provider is wrapping the app and now instead of passing down the store to

07:39.220 --> 07:47.440
the app we can just include it into the provider component and the provider component is going to take

07:47.440 --> 07:56.410
care of passing down the store to all the components down the component tree from the app and we use something

07:56.410 --> 08:02.730
called Connect which we talked about to finish this connection.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.530
So there you have it.

08:04.610 --> 08:14.000
We've created the provider component that passes down the store and the store uses the root reducer or whatever

08:14.000 --> 08:19.660
reducers that we have to create the store and create that object tree of our state.

08:20.820 --> 08:28.950
So in the next video let me save this. In the next video we're going to use the other part of react redux

08:29.100 --> 08:31.520
to finally connect everything together.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.070
I'll see that one. Bye bye.
