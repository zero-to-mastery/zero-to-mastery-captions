00:00.890 --> 00:02.130
Welcome back.

00:02.150 --> 00:10.820
Let's talk about passed by reference versus passed by value to finish our discussion about JavaScript

00:11.030 --> 00:12.110
types.

00:12.230 --> 00:17.330
Now in the previous video I said that primitive types are immutable.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.350
What does that mean.

00:18.350 --> 00:23.090
Well it means that we can't really change them in order to change them.

00:23.090 --> 00:31.140
We need to completely remove the primitive type and let's say if variable A equals five.

00:31.220 --> 00:40.070
Well in order for me to change what that five value is I have to literally move it from memory and create

00:40.070 --> 00:49.020
something new like a equals 10 I can really modify it just something new gets created and primitive

00:49.020 --> 00:57.480
types are exactly like that when I assign a variable a to five somewhere in memory variable a is going

00:57.480 --> 01:06.120
to contain and reference the value five if I do variable B equals two let's say 10 again same thing

01:06.990 --> 01:10.390
and they don't really know of each other's existence.

01:11.230 --> 01:19.530
This is what we call pass by value objects on the other hand are what we call pass by reference let's

01:19.530 --> 01:22.550
write some code to figure out what this really means.

01:22.650 --> 01:36.850
If I do variable A equals to five and then I do variable B equals to 10 well a now has an address of

01:36.910 --> 01:41.450
where this primitive value five sits in memory.

01:41.650 --> 01:49.450
And same with b b has an address of where the primitive value 10 sits in memory.

01:49.450 --> 01:50.880
What if I do B.

01:50.890 --> 01:53.090
Very Bobbie equals two.

01:53.160 --> 02:03.830
Hey what happens then remember primitive types they're passed by value when we do pass by value.

02:04.300 --> 02:08.350
Well what if I do something like B plus plus here.

02:08.350 --> 02:24.190
So that is add one to b if I console dot log a I have five and if I console dot log B I have six and

02:24.310 --> 02:34.460
this is because of past by value all I did or all the JavaScript engine did was copy the primitive type

02:34.760 --> 02:45.180
value five as if I was doing B equals five so that now B has a reference to the value primitive type

02:45.390 --> 02:55.510
five all we did was copy the value so looking at this this diagram should make sense any time even though

02:55.510 --> 03:06.650
we did B equals to a we simply copied the value and put it into a new memory space in our machine remember

03:06.650 --> 03:14.900
our memory heap or our stack where we store information we just simply made a copy they don't really

03:14.900 --> 03:18.860
have any connection whatsoever and that's what passed by.

03:18.860 --> 03:27.620
Value meets pass by value simply means we copy the value and we create that value somewhere else in

03:27.620 --> 03:28.770
memory.

03:28.900 --> 03:35.350
Now let's see how objects are different unlike what we had before or let's keep this here for now just

03:35.350 --> 03:46.240
so you can see if I create an object let's say Object 1 and object 1 has name of Yao and let's say this

03:46.240 --> 03:57.120
is a user that also has a password with 1 2 3 as the password super secure I now and we're also going

03:57.120 --> 04:07.430
to create another object let object to and this is going to be well we can just copy the first object

04:08.240 --> 04:19.230
so object to an object one should be the same right but what if I go ahead and with object 2 I change

04:19.410 --> 04:33.990
password to equal easy peasy what will happen then if I console dialog Object 1 and I also console log

04:35.010 --> 04:35.790
object to

04:38.640 --> 04:51.900
and I run whoa what just happened password has been changed both object one's password and object two's

04:51.900 --> 04:54.670
password were updated by doing this.

04:56.190 --> 05:01.060
And this is due to pass by reference.

05:01.110 --> 05:11.320
You see objects in javascript are stored in memory and are passed by reference which means that we don't

05:11.590 --> 05:15.450
copy the values like we did with primitive types.

05:15.760 --> 05:26.350
We simply when we assigned it object one to object to we're simply said hey this is where the object

05:26.380 --> 05:27.860
is in memory.

05:27.910 --> 05:35.900
If we go back to the code object 1 and object 2 are both pointing somewhere in memory.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.840
We don't know where.

05:36.880 --> 05:43.990
Somewhere in the memory heap to a shelf that contains this information.

05:43.990 --> 05:54.930
So all I did by saying object to equals object want is hey this is let's say the address in memory of

05:54.960 --> 05:57.450
wherever this is located.

05:57.720 --> 06:07.200
So that what that means is when I change object dot password like this I'm saying well change password

06:07.440 --> 06:15.270
on this object in memory that also object one is pointing to its referencing that's where passed by

06:15.270 --> 06:17.010
reference comes from.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.890
Now why do you think that's a good idea.

06:19.930 --> 06:21.060
Let's think about this.

06:21.060 --> 06:23.080
Why is this good.

06:23.140 --> 06:26.150
I mean it's kind of nice right.

06:26.230 --> 06:32.110
Because by just having one object here we're saving space and memory.

06:32.110 --> 06:37.640
We're not copying and cloning the object creating multiple version.

06:37.660 --> 06:46.240
We can simply save memory reference just one location instead of just loading up our memory heap.

06:47.050 --> 06:50.040
But why might this also be bad.

06:50.930 --> 06:58.100
Well because unlike a primitive type we might have this issue where by mistake somebody else changes

06:58.130 --> 07:02.180
a property on that referenced object.

07:02.250 --> 07:07.450
So this is something that we need to be careful let's do another example.

07:07.450 --> 07:12.930
And just to prove like I said before that arrays are simply objects.

07:12.940 --> 07:14.770
Let's try this with an array.

07:15.460 --> 07:26.830
If I do variable C and this variable C has one two three four five and then variable D is equal to C

07:28.480 --> 07:40.080
and then finally we'll say D dot push some giant number on make sure it's a number not a string if I

07:40.080 --> 07:48.190
console log C or let's console log D first and I run this.

07:48.620 --> 07:49.430
I see that.

07:49.430 --> 07:49.770
Yep.

07:49.790 --> 07:58.160
We modified the array but because arrays are objects they're passed by reference C should also have

07:58.160 --> 07:59.370
changed right.

07:59.460 --> 08:05.600
Fight console log C and I run Yep C has also changed as well

08:08.510 --> 08:10.210
we noticed something here right.

08:10.370 --> 08:11.000
This is good.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.860
We're saving memory.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.930
We're not just constantly copying things.

08:14.930 --> 08:18.970
Imagine if C was a massive massive object.

08:19.040 --> 08:26.440
If we're copying two different parts of the code every time well.

08:26.690 --> 08:34.220
This would create a lot of memory but then there are times where maybe we do want to own an object copy

08:34.220 --> 08:36.840
it so that we don't modify it like this.

08:37.610 --> 08:41.150
How can we do that well with something like an array.

08:41.180 --> 08:48.950
There's different ways of doing it but I can simply do array an empty array and then do the cone cat

08:49.070 --> 08:57.380
method which pushes whatever I have in C into this empty array so that when I run here you see that

08:57.470 --> 08:59.940
C is still the same.

09:00.050 --> 09:04.010
But if I go to D I have a new array.

09:04.010 --> 09:06.070
It's cloned an array.

09:06.350 --> 09:09.320
Objects are a little bit more difficult.

09:09.410 --> 09:10.970
Let's say we had an object.

09:12.930 --> 09:20.480
That equals a one let's say B is two.

09:20.570 --> 09:30.350
That's a little confusing let's do a and then B B and then finally c equals C

09:33.510 --> 09:37.780
and this object I want a copy.

09:37.780 --> 09:40.750
I want to have this piece of code.

09:40.750 --> 09:45.590
This object in a different location in memory.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.240
How can we do that.

09:47.260 --> 09:57.660
Well I can't do another object like this because it's simply going to pass by reference and we're still

09:57.660 --> 10:05.830
going to be referencing the same object instead we can clone an object by doing something like this

10:06.550 --> 10:15.920
object dot a sign in here the first parameter is the object to copy to which is an empty object.

10:16.030 --> 10:18.600
And then what is the source.

10:18.610 --> 10:22.510
So that is from which to copy the properties.

10:22.510 --> 10:36.310
So in my case they'll be the object so that now if I change let's say object a far less new object C

10:36.970 --> 10:49.090
to equal five if I console dot log the clone object and I run well I made a little big mistake.

10:49.090 --> 10:50.770
Let's see here.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.220
Knife had a semicolon instead of a comma.

10:54.330 --> 10:54.820
There we go.

10:55.080 --> 11:01.890
If I run this look at that the cloned object was not affected at all.

11:01.890 --> 11:04.940
Even though we changed C to be five.

11:05.580 --> 11:12.060
Remember if we didn't do this we didn't clone it and we just did object that would have been passed

11:12.060 --> 11:17.770
by reference and we would see the change that we saw in the original object but because of object a

11:17.770 --> 11:21.510
sign we were able to clone the object.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.000
Very cool.

11:23.070 --> 11:28.110
There's also another way of doing it and that is using the spread operator.

11:28.170 --> 11:35.010
I can do let alone two equal object or not really.

11:35.070 --> 11:46.180
We just create an object and then do dot dot dot and then the object nice and clean and this is a new

11:46.180 --> 11:53.590
feature that we got in the javascript language which is really really nice and once again if I run this

11:53.590 --> 12:00.460
code I see that clone hasn't been modified and if I do clone to

12:03.570 --> 12:11.280
that hasn't been modified either just for a reference I'll add the original object as well to see that

12:11.670 --> 12:15.150
indeed it is different than what we had before.

12:15.180 --> 12:15.770
Awesome.

12:15.780 --> 12:23.220
So cloning is great but let me ask you this what do you think will happen with the code that we have

12:23.700 --> 12:29.640
if we have an object inside an object.

12:29.860 --> 12:39.220
For example if C instead of just being a string is a another pass by reference object that let's say

12:39.220 --> 12:50.020
has deep as a property and this deep is going to equal try and copy me.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.100
I hope that makes sense.

12:51.100 --> 12:54.500
Let me adjust the indentation here so you see it better.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.840
As to what is happening.

12:57.030 --> 12:59.650
So what happens here.

12:59.700 --> 13:06.960
We have a object that is referenced somewhere in memory and inside of that object there is again another

13:06.960 --> 13:14.170
pointer to another place in memory that references this object let's run this code

13:17.870 --> 13:19.790
well nothing has changed.

13:19.790 --> 13:20.380
Right.

13:20.420 --> 13:23.690
I mean C has obviously changed and.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.060
Well that's something that we already saw before.

13:26.150 --> 13:37.120
But what if I change d this time around instead of C What if I do object dot c dot deep and deep is

13:37.120 --> 13:50.630
now going to say hahaha what do you think will happen here let's run this code and oh no we've just

13:51.230 --> 13:59.560
we cloned everything but it got overwritten I thought we cloned everything what happened here remember

13:59.920 --> 14:03.220
each object gets passed by reference.

14:03.370 --> 14:09.010
So although we cloned the object the initial object.

14:09.280 --> 14:15.340
This is what we call a shallow clone it clone the first level.

14:15.340 --> 14:24.100
So that is the memory address in this object but within this object there was another address to another

14:24.100 --> 14:24.690
object.

14:24.700 --> 14:32.280
So again remember this is just another address that we had someplace in memory and this address.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.000
Well it never changed.

14:34.050 --> 14:37.200
It always referenced this object.

14:37.260 --> 14:44.330
So this is shallow cloning where we can only clone the first layer.

14:44.390 --> 14:45.890
That's a big problem right.

14:45.890 --> 14:53.020
How can we do deep cloning and the way we can do this is.

14:53.210 --> 15:06.770
Well a little funky we use Jason we say let super clone and we're going to use the Jason dot pass method

15:08.630 --> 15:10.820
and this is beyond the scope of the course.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.800
You can read up on what Jason pass does.

15:13.940 --> 15:24.580
But this Jason object is going to say Jason dot stringy ify let's make this a little bit bigger.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.550
There you go.

15:25.550 --> 15:33.270
We're going to string ify that is turn everything in here into a string and then once we turn everything

15:33.270 --> 15:40.920
into a string we're going to pass it and turn that string back into an object so that if I do super

15:40.920 --> 15:41.490
clone now

15:44.600 --> 15:55.530
at the bottom here let's do super clone and I run look at that try and copy me super clone.

15:55.610 --> 15:58.540
Let's make this a little bit smaller.

15:58.550 --> 15:59.320
There you go.

15:59.390 --> 16:09.340
Super clone version did a deep clone of the object very very cool now before.

16:09.360 --> 16:13.740
And this video I hope passed by reference and passed by value makes sense to you.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.720
Now I do want to give you a bit of a warning.

16:16.800 --> 16:26.920
However if you're doing a deep clone Well you should be careful because this can have some performance

16:26.920 --> 16:33.720
implications if this object was extremely deep a massive object.

16:33.850 --> 16:38.240
It's going to take a long time to clone everything right.

16:38.320 --> 16:43.540
So you won't see this out in the wild too much if you're cloning objects like this.

16:43.690 --> 16:47.320
There's most likely some other ways that you should be doing things.

16:47.410 --> 16:54.520
But I wanted to show you the idea of pass by reference the idea of shallow cloning deep cloning and

16:54.610 --> 17:01.590
some of the ways that we can use objects to get the desired.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.790
All right I hope that was fun.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.820
I'll see you in the next video by.
