00:01.850 --> 00:03.660
Type coercion.

00:03.890 --> 00:09.940
If there's one thing that's gonna make you pull out all your hair out of frustration.

00:10.150 --> 00:19.290
It's type caution if you Google type origin in JavaScript and looked at some of the posts you're going

00:19.290 --> 00:26.310
to see a lot of people angry at some of the funky things that JavaScript does and we're going to talk

00:26.310 --> 00:32.700
about that and I'm going to just give you a brief overview of it because it does get really convoluted

00:32.730 --> 00:39.390
complex and it's something that you should understand and know what it is but you don't have to know

00:39.510 --> 00:43.630
every single detail because most of the tricky parts.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.060
Well you shouldn't be using it in your code because it's confusing.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.500
So what is type cause.

00:51.620 --> 00:59.620
It's something like this one equals two string one and that equals two.

00:59.690 --> 01:08.000
True you see type caution means that when the appearance that is the things to the left and to the right

01:08.510 --> 01:13.070
of the operator are different types.

01:13.120 --> 01:21.730
That is no end string type one of them will be converted into an equivalent value by the JavaScript

01:21.790 --> 01:22.150
engine.

01:22.990 --> 01:27.740
So the JavaScript engine is going to say 1 equals to string 1.

01:27.940 --> 01:29.890
I think you mean number one.

01:29.890 --> 01:39.550
So it's going to do this for us and compare number one to number one now based on the definition type

01:39.640 --> 01:47.100
caution means the language converting a certain type to another type.

01:47.150 --> 01:55.460
Let me ask you a question do all languages have type caution.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.900
What do you think yes they do.

01:59.470 --> 02:07.230
Because we always need to convert types between programs to do things in memory.

02:07.290 --> 02:12.240
Different types look completely different than what we type.

02:12.250 --> 02:16.290
Write the number five in actual physical memory.

02:16.290 --> 02:23.070
Oh my computer is represented in once in zero and all languages do this.

02:23.070 --> 02:29.110
So there is some sort of type caution at different levels of the stack.

02:29.430 --> 02:37.650
It just so happens that JavaScript has an especially heavy type cause in nature to it because it's dynamically

02:37.650 --> 02:40.460
type which is why it does this.

02:40.500 --> 02:50.170
Let's go back to the example in JavaScript type caution happens when you use the double equal double

02:50.170 --> 02:59.410
equal sign simply means compare the two values and if they have different types try to well coerce one

02:59.920 --> 03:00.790
into the same type.

03:02.330 --> 03:13.880
If we go back and do a string here and I do three equals and I run I get false because three equals

03:13.940 --> 03:17.180
in JavaScript means compare to values.

03:17.360 --> 03:25.300
But don't try and curse the values be explicit with your comparison and do exactly what I tell you.

03:25.470 --> 03:32.000
So is there ever a time you should just use two equals instead of three equals.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.340
Mm hmm.

03:33.510 --> 03:34.410
I'll say that.

03:34.410 --> 03:35.970
No there isn't.

03:36.000 --> 03:43.930
Some people may argue that double equal can actually have some interesting applications where we coerce

03:44.010 --> 03:51.890
something and we do some sort of checking really quickly but it's not predictable code right.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.000
It can be confusing.

03:53.040 --> 04:00.100
It could really be a gotcha and trick some people so always use three equals instead of two.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.590
Now type caution doesn't happen just with the equals sign.

04:04.590 --> 04:06.870
You can also do an if statement.

04:07.020 --> 04:19.930
So if one then return five and if I run this well there's no function in here less to console.

04:21.030 --> 04:22.900
I've been recording for a long day today right.

04:22.910 --> 04:24.560
So give me a break everybody.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.360
All right.

04:25.530 --> 04:29.540
If I run this five is logged.

04:29.580 --> 04:30.450
Why is that.

04:30.480 --> 04:35.400
Because javascript course is one to equal true.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.930
What if I do zero here.

04:36.990 --> 04:44.220
If I do zero no javascript course is this and says well I want to boolean here.

04:44.430 --> 04:53.050
So I'm going to take your zero and turn that into a false now this sort of type caution there is a lot

04:53.050 --> 04:55.390
of interesting specifics to it.

04:56.260 --> 05:02.470
And as a matter of fact there's a nice little website that shows you some of the comparisons that JavaScript

05:02.470 --> 05:04.990
does with three equals.

05:04.990 --> 05:08.920
That is with no type caution things make sense.

05:08.920 --> 05:13.860
You see that false equals two false and that's it.

05:13.910 --> 05:23.070
You can see that string false only triple equals and returns true with string false again.

05:23.540 --> 05:26.740
But if we do double equals well.

05:27.440 --> 05:27.810
Oh boy.

05:27.830 --> 05:30.790
That's just a mess isn't it.

05:30.800 --> 05:41.210
For example string one is the same as true an array that contains one is also true when it's compared

05:41.210 --> 05:42.880
to string of one.

05:43.100 --> 05:47.200
And there are so many weird little edge cases here.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.820
If you want to play around with this go for it.

05:49.820 --> 05:53.330
But I'd like to stick with triple equals.

05:53.360 --> 06:03.260
You can also see some of the if statements here and some of the F cases that can really be tricky now

06:03.380 --> 06:10.550
if we go to this MDMA page which I will link to in this video we see that we have the double equals

06:11.090 --> 06:12.410
the triple equals.

06:12.500 --> 06:20.270
But then also something called Object dot is that's fairly new to JavaScript and this is an interesting

06:20.270 --> 06:23.380
one that you most likely won't see very often.

06:23.390 --> 06:24.790
But I think it's interesting.

06:24.800 --> 06:31.730
So we're going to talk about it just quickly you see in JavaScript there is a concept of negative zero

06:32.360 --> 06:35.120
and plus zero.

06:35.120 --> 06:35.850
Strange I know.

06:36.200 --> 06:48.850
So if I do negative zero triple equals plus zero and I run I get true but they're technically different

06:49.030 --> 06:55.180
things in JavaScript so I can actually do object dot is

06:59.190 --> 07:04.190
and given the two parameters and run and I get false.

07:04.400 --> 07:12.910
Now why is this useful if we go back to this page we see that object that is works pretty much the same

07:12.940 --> 07:16.300
as the triple equals except for a few cases.

07:16.420 --> 07:19.220
That is the plus and negative 0.

07:19.390 --> 07:29.790
And if we scroll all the way down to this funky little and a n not a no and we can do a whole course

07:29.790 --> 07:39.360
on how weird this not a number is but if I did not a number which represents not in numbers in JavaScript

07:39.700 --> 07:46.020
and I do triple equals not a number I get false but why is that.

07:46.020 --> 07:49.200
This is this should be equal right.

07:49.470 --> 07:54.240
So if we use object that is this turns into true.

07:54.240 --> 08:01.470
Again most likely in your day to day programming life you're never going to encounter this problem.

08:01.680 --> 08:09.140
But I wanted to demonstrate for you how confusing type caution can be and if you're the type of person

08:09.140 --> 08:14.860
that just loves type caution and wants to read all about it and understand all these intricacies I'll

08:14.870 --> 08:22.880
linked to the actual spec that talks about how the equality comparison algorithm works for me if I read

08:22.910 --> 08:26.440
this I'll be a good bedtime reading to make me fall asleep.

08:26.570 --> 08:28.970
If you're interested in it you can have a look.

08:28.970 --> 08:36.980
The main takeaway from here is that well you should use triple equals because type caution in JavaScript

08:37.220 --> 08:39.780
can be really tricky.

08:39.970 --> 08:46.090
By the way as a fun little side note there's a screen capture I took from Netflix watching this great

08:46.270 --> 08:51.650
hilarious documentary and you see that bugs in the code are unavoidable.

08:51.730 --> 08:58.300
Even the mighty Netflix every once in a while has an issue somewhere not a number.

08:58.300 --> 08:58.670
All right.

08:58.870 --> 08:59.760
That's it for now.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.230
I see in the next one by.
