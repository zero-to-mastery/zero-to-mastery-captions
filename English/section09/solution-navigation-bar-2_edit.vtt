00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.740
Wellcome back! In the last video we had this problem of
the view getting a little bit ugly with our navigation

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.630
as we became smaller and
smaller with our viewport.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.100
How can we fix this?

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.029
And here I'm going to show you a topic that actually
cover in my next course but just because it might

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.550
be useful for this case I'm going to introduce you
to something called media queries and media queries

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.989
allow us to create responsive websites and tell our
web pages what to do when the size of our screen

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.020
gets small or big.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.870
And I'll link to this website over here.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:48.099
But essentially what it allows us to do with media
queries we can have devices tablets laptops wearables

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.920
that have different screen sizes and tell it how
to display our web page based on those sizes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.040
For example here it shows us what our viewports
will be for iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S and using this

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:13.330
syntax of @ media only screen and giving it
some min-device-width and max-device-width.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:22.359
We can tell it how to display our page or have CSS
properties specific to just this view size that

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.360
is minimum view size is going to
be 320 pixel and max is 480 pixels.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.530
And as you can imagine there is a lot of these
based on different devices and viewports.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.959
Now things like CSS grid and flexbox actually resolve
a lot of this but I want to demonstrate just

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.670
one use case with our little example
that is this contacts getting smushed.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.480
So let's create our own media query
for our navigation. In order to do that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:04.690
all we need to do is say '@media' we say 'only
screen' and this is saying what do we want our media

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.600
query for.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:11.109
And you can do things like print here for example
when you're printing something but 99 percent of the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.070
time you're just going to have screen.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:25.420
And here we're going to say 'and' we'll say that
'max-width' is going to be 600px that is use this

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:34.239
CSS properties that we're about to define right
here only when max-width its 600px that is as soon

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.880
as this is less than 600px

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:46.850
in witdh, apply these properties here so
I'll say main-nav will have a font-size.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.979
We can do different things here but let's just say
a smaller font size and maybe will do padding of

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.800
zero just so they're closer together.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.790
If I save this and refresh.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.860
Look at that!

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.399
Everything fits in because our font size is smaller
and we've removed any extra padding that we may

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.400
have.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:17.509
But notice here as I make things bigger you see
that as soon as I pass 600px we restore our

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.450
defaults with larger font size.
Look at that!

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.810
So using media queries we just
made our navbar more responsive.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.410
Nice and easy.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:40.690
And this is a common pattern that I recommend with
your navigation that is having our nav element with

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.660
an unordered list and an li list.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.879
Our main-nav which will be a flexbox and we'll
have a push class that uses this margin left

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.390
auto

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.640
to push whatever we want to
our nav to the right side.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.760
Usually something like contact or log-in
to have it all the way to the right.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.900
So hopefully this wasn't too bad.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.690
Like I said you don't
need to memorize this.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.609
You can even copy the code that I'll leave for you
at the end of these videos once you get used to this

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.619
syntax you now have a solid
foundation to build the navigation.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.010
But we have three more things to go so
let's get to that in the next video.
