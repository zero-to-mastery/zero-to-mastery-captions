00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.690
Let's move on to the project grid.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.669
Something that we see a lot of in websites whether
it's an image gallery or a list of your portfolio

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.790
projects.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.450
Grid systems are very
important and very common.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.700
And as we know we learned the perfect
way to create a grid CSS grid, right.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.330
So let's see how this will look like.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.010
And my ideal implementation.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.340
First I want to go to the HTML page and
now let's make this a little bit bigger.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:45.149
In our project grid div I know I want to use CSS grid
so I'm going to create a wrapper around this project

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.770
grid so I'm going to have a div

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.879
and this div will have a class of some properties
that we'll add CSS to and just to keep things blue

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.610
the way they are.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.599
I'm going to give it that zone blue class that we
have below but we're going to make it a CSS grid

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.630
song going to just say grid-wrapper.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.610
And we can just remove the project grid.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.040
And in here add a couple
of sample little projects.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.940
If you remember in our solution file I left for you
a couple of images that you can just add like this

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.830
so that we have some
sort of a project grid.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.620
I'm not going to bore you with me typing all that out
because that's something that we've done before.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:45.829
Just gonna copy and paste a div here with box zone
boxes are classes that we haven't added yet but we're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.099
going to create these are going to be the grid items
we have zone which again is something that we've

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.590
already defined before and our images.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.769
So if I save this and refresh
and let's refresh again.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.280
All right.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.890
This is absolutely hideous does not look pretty at
all but at least we have the images provide it but

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.979
no employer is going to be
impressed if they see this right.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.720
So let's actually make
this into a grid system.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:28.809
If we go back to the style tab let's add our grid
here and obviously as the name suggests when it comes

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.600
to grids CSS grids is the way to go.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.890
And there's many ways that we can lay things out and
that's something that we've already talked about

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.760
in our CSS grid videos.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.370
So we're going to keep things simple.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.820
First is we want to actually say
hey we're going to use CSS grid.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.380
So we're going to use the grid-wrapper class that we
created which was this div that wraps all our projects

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:08.429
and we'll say display grid we'll say that we want
the grid-gap to be 20px and then finally the our

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:16.730
favorite property that is grid-template-columns
and so everything is responsive.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:30.150
We'll say repeat auto-fill and we'll say
that the minmax will be let's say 350px.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:37.389
So that is the minimum and the maximum will be '1fr'
so that it fills the entire page when it's really

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:38.390
really small.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:48.179
So that if I save this and refresh. All right.
That still looks pretty hideous doesn't it.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.789
And that's because our images are well they're
pretty massive and you see that they're also not all

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.660
the same size or they
have different padding.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.079
So the way to just fix that quickly and something
that you'll see a lot with images is to give them

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:14.489
a width of 100 percent in our case that we can just
say box because remember each div has a box class

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:16.400
that we haven't really said anything about.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.990
And then an image.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:26.229
So using our CSS selector knowledge I can just say
all children of box that are images I want the

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:34.550
width to be 100 percent.
If I save and refresh.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.990
All right.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.770
That's perfect.

00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:42.930
Now you see that each image has 100 percent width
that as it fills in the entire piece of the card.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:53.260
And if I make this bigger and smaller you see that
it adjusts very very cool but still pretty ugly.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.780
But we have the CSS grid
working as you can see.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.090
As soon as it's less than 350px
it changes the grid system.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.640
So next we want to work
on the individual cards.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:18.180
That is we want to have our box and here we don't
really need to add any extra grid properties.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.539
I mean we could if we want but I like the way
things look I like everything being symmetrical.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.349
I want all the items in
the grid to be the same.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:36.569
So in here we can just add our simple CSS properties
like let's say background color and we'll just

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:44.309
give it a color of let's say '#444' so that we
have this dark color and we definitely don't

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.760
want these images just to be this big.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:55.440
So we'll give it a padding of 130px
and maybe some margin as well of 20px.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.900
If I save and refresh that's a lot better.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.880
And remember because we said that the
width of the image is 100 percent.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.980
It's going to try and fill the entire box.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:15.740
But because the box now has padding of 130 both the
top the bottom and to the left and right the width

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.040
is now just this part.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.290
So that looks a lot better.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:26.800
And if we look over here we now
have a completely responsive

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:30.540
grid system.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.850
How cool is that!

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.040
And how simple was that using CSS grid.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.020
Luckily for us the last thing
we need to do is this footer.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.610
And because the footer is at the very bottom
it just going to stay at the very bottom.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.829
The only thing that we might want to do is to make
sure that the text is centered so in our case we

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.070
can just say footer and as you guessed.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.090
Yes it's text-align.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.710
Our best friend.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:05.240
Center. If I refresh and make sure that
I spelled properly if I save and refresh.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:13.040
Well that's not going to work because we should
change our footer which is div to more of a semantic

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:15.500
a HTML tag of footer.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.360
Now if I save and refresh this
is in the center it looks great.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.830
Let's say zero to mastery because
our layout is looking really nice.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.440
And there you have it.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.810
That wasn't that bad, was it?

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.460
I mean sure.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:47.819
The first time around that's kind of difficult but the
principles that I've showed you here can be transferred

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.900
to a lot of websites.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.070
I mean this looks pretty ugly.

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:58.559
You're not going to want to visit a website that looks
like this but when it comes to layout everything

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.210
is responsive and nice, right?

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:07.320
And you can imagine yourself expanding
on this and building a beautiful website.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.110
I wanted to show you this layout system because this
is what I would use if I was building a website.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:19.260
I would start off with the HTML and
create the layout that is responsive.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.659
Because after this all I really need
to do is add text, images and colors.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.430
Maybe some CSS styles to make it pretty
so that you can turn something like this.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:37.349
That doesn't look good but has the layout implemented
into something like this which I mean doesn't

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:44.010
look that great yet but in the next video I want
to show you how because we have the layouts set up

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:49.490
we can convert our base layout
project into something like this.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.350
And less than five minutes.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.150
So let's do that in the next video.
