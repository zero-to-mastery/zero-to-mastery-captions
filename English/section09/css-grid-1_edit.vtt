00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.849
Wellcome back!

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.970
I've given you some starter files so I recommend
watching these videos as you code along as well on

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.510
your computer.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.519
We have a few animal cards here that are extremely
cute obviously right now if we look at what we have

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:24.310
we have an HTML page with just simple divs
that contain these little emojis of animals.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.440
And if we go to the style tab I've prefilled a few
things for you just so things look good but all we're

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.709
really doing here is we have a few colors and we've
added gradients here just so it looks a little bit

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.679
nicer and we have the zones which are these individual
cards with some predefined CSS properties that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.360
we've already seen in the previous videos
just with this base CSS that we have.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.920
We see that we have some
really nice looking cards.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.000
And right now we're using
'display: inline-block'.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.569
If I change this to 'display: block'
and I save this let's refresh.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.429
We see that we now have blocks. That's great! But we
want a little bit more control and perhaps make this

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.520
grid a little bit more responsive.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.999
Maybe look a little bit different and just overall
cleaner and when it comes to grids CSS grid is a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.450
way to go.

00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:30.080
So how do we use it?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:38.040
Well the first thing we need to do is
to have a container, around these items.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:47.030
So I'm just going to create a new div and give it a
class of container. We can name it whatever we want

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.560
but containers are nice

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.620
descriptive class name.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.190
And we wrap all the
items in this container.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.490
Now the way CSS grid works
is very similar to flexbox.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:12.770
That is we give it the property of display grid and
all the children will now be able to be part of

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.959
this grid system.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.819
So let's see what that looks like.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:25.530
I'm going to have the container class and
this container class will have display

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.020
grid.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.150
So remember with flexbox we can do flex.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.150
It's similar to that.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.299
We do display grid and we no longer want to use the
display block of the zones because we're going to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.529
have a grid system.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.509
So I'm just going to comment this for now we've just
declared this as a grid system but we actually

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.930
need to tell it what to do now.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:59.769
And the most important part of CSS grid is this
property 'grid-template-columns' and most likely you're

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:06.409
going to be using this in all your CSS grid
implementation and where we can use these grid template

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.959
columns is to tell our page how
many columns we want to use. In here

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:24.250
if I say something like 300px and 300px I save
and refresh here. Look at that! I have 300px

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.229
and then 300px and automatically it because I've
declared it this way with two definitions or two

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.729
values.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.420
It assumes that we have two grids,
two grids of 300px and 300px.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:52.140
So if I make this larger or smaller it's
always going to have 300px two columns.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.419
If I had let's say another
300px here and save refresh.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.050
Look at that!

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.420
We now have three columns.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.069
Very very nice.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:11.400
Another one that you'll see
a lot of is the 'grid-gap'.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.040
And as you might guess from the name it tells
us how much gap we want between the grids.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.640
So if I do 20px here and I refresh
see that we get 20px of gap.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.759
Now this looks really good right now.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:35.470
But if I change things around this isn't really
responsive because each column is 300px wide.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.180
And as we know users have
different display sizes.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.689
So you get these ugly grids where
you have white space over here.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.110
How will we go about solving this?

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:57.249
And you might be thinking what if we just do percentages
here what if we had four columns and we say

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:04.850
'25% 25% 25% 25%' if I refresh this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.800
I have four columns but there's
still some scrolling involved

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.070
although we see that things are
a little bit more responsive now.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.159
Now you can totally do percentages
with 'grid-template-columns'

00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:31.283
and it's definitely a lot better
than using something like pixels.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.160
But you now have to start calculating
the fact that you also have a grid gap of

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.139
20px and well CSS grid actually gives us a
really really good tool that I recommend you

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:48.010
use 100 percent of the time instead of
percentages or pixels or ems or rems.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.170
And that is called a 'fr' or a fraction.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.939
Now what does the 'fr' syntax mean? If I do
'1fr' here and I save, now let's refresh.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.940
All right I get one item. 'fr' means we have one
fraction in this column so just fill it all up.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.160
If I do '1fr' again and I
refresh I get two columns.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.720
But look at this as I
expand and make it smaller.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:30.160
It automatically resizes because I'm saying
I want two columns that are '1fr', '1fr'.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:41.439
Now a better way to explain what this far value means
is if I do something like '2fr' here. What do you

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.440
think will happen?

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.559
If I save and refresh; this
should give you a better idea.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.190
All we're saying is we want 3 columns.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:07:01.999
And in terms of the proportion or the sizes I want
the first two columns to be half the size of the

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.730
third column.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.690
Because in terms of fractions,
this is twice as big as the other ones.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:16.330
As I make this larger and larger it's always
going to say and keep those proportions.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.280
This is going to be twice
as large as the other ones.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:29.989
So when you using CSS grid this is the best way for
you to maintain this grid system and make sure

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.840
that it's responsive.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.110
How cool is that!

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:39.800
Just by writing three properties saying that we want
to use the grid system adding maybe a 'grid-gap'

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:48.549
and 'grid-template-columns' with these 'fr' values
we've made a grid system that is quite responsive but

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:52.260
there are a few more properties
that we can use in CSS grid.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.100
So let's check them out in the next video.
