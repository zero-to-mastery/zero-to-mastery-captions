00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.040
Welcome back!

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.470
Now that we have our navigation
let's focus on our cover.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.690
If we go back to our HTML page we have our cover div
here and we can just keep the div here as it is

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.810
because we don't really know what the cover will be
just yet but I want to add a new CSS class called

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.990
container here.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.159
And this container is going to define some properties
for us that will make this truly a cover image

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.420
just like we have in our
solution web page over here.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:41.790
And let's add those exclamation marks because
we're excited not for contacts for the cover.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.360
Let's add the exclamation marks over here.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.380
Nice.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.480
All right.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:55.910
We'll go to our style.css and
we'll add on our cover style now.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.030
This is actually going to be fairly easy.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:10.019
We want to have let's say display of flex or first
of all let's make sure that we have the container

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.809
class and we'll have a display of flex and I'm not
using grid here because well we're not going to have

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.509
any grid items we won't have that many items in a
cover it's usually a button or a background image

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.370
or some text and display flex
just makes things nice and simple.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.379
And usually we want things in the cover to be centered
that is we want this cover to be right in the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.000
center.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.870
And as we make things smaller it's
always going to be in the center.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.280
That's something that we see
a lot of in a lot of websites.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.219
And to do that especially
with Flexbox is really easy.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:57.990
All we need to say is to align-items center
and to justify-content center just like that.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.280
If I save here and refresh.
All right this is centered.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:12.249
And as I move things perfect everything is absolutely
centered but obviously cover image should be a

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.899
little bit larger, right?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.980
What do we do here?

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.899
And I want to introduce to you something that
you haven't seen before but don't get scared.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.900
It's not that hard.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.779
I'm going to have height and just to start us off I'm
going to show you usually you might do something

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.620
like 500px and if I refresh.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.240
Awesome.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.860
I have a nice little height but
there's a problem here, right?

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:45.079
Because I'm saying 500px here if the viewport if
I move things around if I lift things up you'll

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:53.910
see that all right the view is not responsive
when I go up because it's always 500px.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.649
And this might not be the worst idea ever.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.600
Maybe you want your
website to be like that.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.969
But if you do want this to be responsive in terms
of going up and down as well what we can do is use

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:16.969
something called the 'vh' that is the viewport height
and I like using viewport height a new unit that

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.270
we haven't seen before for making things
responsive when it comes to height.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.569
And what this states it's going to look at the viewport
that is the view of the web page and make sure

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.690
that there's always a percentage of that
viewport dedicated to this container.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:47.719
So if I do 50vh and if I refresh here you'll see
that my cover will be 50 percent of our viewport.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.360
If I do 100 and I refresh

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.810
you see that the cover fills
up the entire viewport.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:09.269
The cool part is if I go up and down this adjusts
exactly according to the viewport height that is the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.560
window of the browser.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.700
Very cool right.

00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:15.040
And everything is still centered.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.560
So I like using the vh for
something like a container.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.820
So let's keep it at 50 and if I refresh
look at that nice and responsive.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.910
How cool is that!

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.140
And that's it for the cover.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.280
Not that hard, right?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.400
Let's move on to the project
grid in the next video. Bye bye.
