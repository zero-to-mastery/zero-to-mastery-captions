00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:02.480
Welcome back.

00:00:02.481 --> 00:00:07.490
Now that we've gotten used to this CSS grid
system let's introduce a few more properties.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.630
Now another thing we can do with CSS grid
because remember I said it was two dimensional.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.630
That is we can control the rows as well.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.070
So far this is something
that flexbox can do as well.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.879
We can do something like 'grid-template-rows' now
and actually define the way the rows should look as

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.880
well.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.029
So let's say I want to do '1fr 2fr'.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.580
What do you think will happen?

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.420
Let's see.

00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:47.060
I'm going to save and refresh
and look at that. The first row

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.149
has '1fr' but the second row is twice
as big as the first one as we can see here.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.160
And because of the way CSS grid works in the third
row because we haven't really added a third column

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.060
automatically if there's more items
it's going to just start repeating.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.770
So the next row which is the
third row will have '1fr'.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.550
So I can define different things here.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.030
I can say '3fr' for the third row
and let's say '5fr' for the last row.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.280
If I refresh and save.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:40.659
If I save and refresh here we see that we have our
new columns or rows but that looks ugly so let's

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.600
just keep it at '1fr' which is the default.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:56.129
Now another thing that we can do and you'll see a lot
of is the repeat function that we can add to something

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.850
like 'grid-template-columns'.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.370
So instead of doing this over
here I can say 'repeat()'.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.299
And now I say how many times
I want to repeat something.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.740
So the first number is how many times
so let's say three times repeat '1fr'.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.750
So that's like saying '1fr' '1fr' '1fr'
three times.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:34.020
If I save this and refresh I get one two
three if I do four here and I refresh.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.370
I get four.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.500
And you can imagine what
happens if we do six.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.210
We just keep repeating things.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:53.569
Another thing that we can do is the auto property and
the auto property just simply means fill in whatever

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.480
available space we have.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:06.579
So if I do something like 'auto 1fr 2fr' and I refresh
here you'll notice that the first column doesn't

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.530
really have any spaces
outside of the emoji.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.550
And 'auto' can also be thought of
as the max size of the content.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:27.950
If I make this fox let's say have a content of two
and I refresh you'll see that the 'auto' property

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.730
automatically resizes to fit the content.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.089
And because this entire layout is on a grid system
it will make sure that the ones below it will have

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.540
the same size.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:48.990
If I do '1fr' here and I refresh you'll see the difference
of all we're talking about it's not automatically

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.880
scaling this first grid.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:00.980
Instead it's going to keep the portions that we have
and extend anything below it that doesn't fit so

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.150
'auto' is another really
really good feature to use.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280
But let's fix that.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.170
All right let's tackle a few more
properties in the next video.
