Another thing I want to show you with the individual
item in a grid is that we can do something like

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.510
justify-self.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:20.499
Remember up here we did justify-items and align-items
but when it comes to individual items we have to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.710
use self.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:30.920
And as you can imagine if I do self start and I
refresh your we go to the start of the column.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:43.370
If I do align it's going to go to the start of the
row and if we do end and refresh again we see that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.250
the same thing is happening.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.600
I'm going to leave this file for you
as well so you can play around with it.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.089
I encourage you to try to create different types of
grids and looks that you want as you can see it's

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:05.829
pretty powerful but also very very simple and allows
us to create responsive grid systems very very

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.119
easily.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.039
Now there's actually a cheat sheet that you can use
to summarize everything that I've taught you up

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.550
until now there's a link to this video.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.860
It's called the, well,
the grid cheat sheet.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.850
And it shows you exactly why you
need to do for the container.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:32.369
We've learned about grid-gap grid-templates align-items
and also what to do with the children such as

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.870
grid-column, justify-self, align-self and it has all
these little snippets that you can just click on and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.650
copy.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.660
So I recommend you play around with
some of these properties on your own.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.100
Because in the next part we're going to use
CSS grid to build a complete website layout.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.940
I'll see in that one. Bye bye.
