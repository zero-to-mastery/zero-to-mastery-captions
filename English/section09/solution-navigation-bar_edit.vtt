00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:02.609
Welcome back.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.320
How was the exercise?
Hopefully wasn't too difficult.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.230
But if it was and you
weren't able to finish it.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.189
Don't worry we're going to go over the steps and
luckily for you once we do this you'll have a template

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.039
that you can use for all your websites because what
we'll build will be something responsive that you

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.089
can customize to your own liking but you'll at least
know the best practices after this video of how to do

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.000
these common patterns that
we see in a lot of websites.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.030
So let's get started.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.110
The first thing I want to do to
convert this page is well a few things.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:49.589
Let's go to the HTML page first and let's start off
with the navigation that is the header over here.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.960
A lot of websites have some
sort of a header at the top.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.720
The first thing I want to do is to actually use semantic
HTML and be more descriptive in what are doing.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.059
So in our case instead of div I'm going to use
the nav HTML element and this is something that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:16.340
we've already talked about and instead of just having
header here I'm going to have a ul class or ul

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.080
element that will have a
class name of main-nav.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:34.589
And in here we can just have li elements that will
have an anchor tag and because we don't really

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.039
have we won't have any links for this example we
can obviously do whatever new HTML page that we

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.120
want to reference but for now
we can just leave it blank.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.720
So the first one will let's just say be about and we
can copy and paste this for the other items as well.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:02.480
We'll have let's just say
products we'll say our team.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:10.890
And then finally we'll have contact.
If I save this and refresh.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.510
There is our navigation doesn't
look very good does it in real life.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:23.109
Most of the time we see the navigation at the top
and sometimes we also see that there's navigation

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.249
links at the top and one all the way to
the right that's pushed to the right edge.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.540
Such as contacts.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.710
So let's try and do that where we have about products
in our team at the top over here and then contacts

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.500
all the way to the right at the very edge.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.579
So for that we can create a new class at the very
last item that we want to let's say push and we'll

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.539
add the CSS classes.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:58.930
Now if I go to our let's say this first if I go to
style.css We can create our navigation here now.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.060
We have the main nav class which we've
created and in here we want to use flexbox.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.660
So I'm going to say display flex to activate
flexbox sounds cool when I say activate flexbox.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:26.130
I want to make sure I remove these little dots in
front of the names so I can just say the list-style

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.010
none which will remove
these little pointers.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.250
And let's say that we want the
font size to be let's say 0.7.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320
em.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.840
If I save and refresh here.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.360
All right things are a little
bit better but still not perfect.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.000
One is we want to remove any margins.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.480
So I'm going to say margin: 0.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.510
If I refresh.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.379
All right we've removed some margins but still not
pretty we want to perhaps add some spaces in between

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:11.409
these things I'm going to just have the li class which
is our navigation items and I'll just say that we

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.440
want the padding to be 20px I refresh.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.760
That's a lot better.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.890
OK.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.680
And just to clean things up
let's say that our anchor tags.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:36.069
We also want them to be able to have a color of
let's just use '#f5f5f6' if I refresh it's nice

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.100
and whitish that looks good.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:46.480
And we don't want those underline so I'm
going to say text-decoration: none. Refresh.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:53.810
All good now because I want to start
structuring this as an actual web page.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.429
I'm going to go to our zone class and just remove
our padding and margin because we don't really need

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.370
it.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:08.670
Refresh here. Things are going to start looking
ugly but at least we've moved all this whitespace

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.519
and then finally our display.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.920
We're no longer going to use inline-block.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.560
We want to start using
our flexbox or CSS grid.

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:25.190
In our case our main nav is going to have flex
display so we don't need our inline-block anymore.

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.380
We're going to save and refresh.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:35.639
And that's a lot better because divs are automatically
blocked our displays for these bottom ones are

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.410
now going to just be blocks.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:46.490
But our top one our navbar has flex now which is great
but you'll notice here we have a bit of a white

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.410
gap and this is very common
when you're working with CSS.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.340
Sometimes browsers by default have
some sort of CSS attached to them.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:08.040
In this case in Google Chrome our body element already
has some predefined CSS classes that are pre-built

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:14.220
by chrome so we can actually remove those
and make sure that our margins are zero.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.670
By saying margin:

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.640
auto 0.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.900
And this is something I'll
make sure I spell that right.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:26.579
This is something that you'll see a lot of and
you'll do a lot of when it comes to just making sure

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.890
that the styles are at least
the margins are correct.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:36.059
When you start off. So if I refresh here. Look at
that! Margins are on and everything just filled

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.630
on the page which is great.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:46.150
The last thing I want to do is to move contacts all
the way up to the right and remember the push class

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.270
that we added.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.360
Well that's going to be super easy to do.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:07:05.029
All we need to do is to add a push CSS class that
says margin-left to be auto and with this auto if

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:10.190
I refresh contacts goes
all the way to the right.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.030
If I inspect this element.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:19.549
So I just right click and click on inspect and let's
make this a little bit bigger so we can see if

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.250
I hover over li push here.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:30.419
We see that each li element has its
own box but because we did margin-left

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.489
auto, our li element

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:39.299
it's going to get automatically push because it has
this automatic margin that it creates to the very

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:39.830
end.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.540
If I did margin-right for
example and I refresh here

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:52.800
Our margin would now actually be all the way to the
right to fill up the entire width of the viewport.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.900
But let's go back to left.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.550
Let's go back to the left
save and refresh here.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.949
The neat part about this is
that with this margin-left

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:13.080
auto, I can now resize our page and you'll see
that contacts is always going to be to our right.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.959
This is something that you'll see in a lot
of websites and we did that fairly fast.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.550
Not too bad, right?

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:27.319
The last thing I want to fix here is as you'll notice
as we get closer and closer it kind of overlaps

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:28.140
our team

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:33.650
and well now we have this weird
little contacts that overflows.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.350
How can we fix this?

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.940
Let's tackle that in the next video.
