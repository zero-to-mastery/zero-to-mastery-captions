00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:11.979
Another property that is very important when it
comes to CSS grid is 'justify-items' and justify

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.249
items and the default is right now.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.680
Stretch.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.579
So that if I refresh this nothing's going to change
but if I do start and refresh it aligns the contents

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.800
in a grid item along what
we call the row axes.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:42.110
So the row axes is each row if I do end and I
refresh we see that there now towards the end.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.880
But a better way to visualize this is
to actually use our developer tools.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:59.969
So if I go to view&gt;developer&gt;developer tools and we
select our grid you see that by clicking on this

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.720
pointing icon and hovering over it in Google
Chrome we actually see our grid system.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.630
And if I scroll you see that
it actually stays in place.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.360
But you see that we now have our
items at the end of our grid system.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.770
Our last item which is '2fr' right
over here is justified to the end.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:33.839
Our second column is justified to the end and we see
a bit of a gap here and that is because remember

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:43.709
we have '1fr' and then the first item because it's
auto and the size is according to its content doesn't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.390
really move whether we have end or start here it's
already within the maxed space of the grid system.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.910
And just like we have
the axes around the row.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:07.430
If I change this to 'align-items' and I save and
refresh this is hard to see so let's just do five or

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.150
300px and refresh here.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.870
We see that align-items is the exact opposite where
it's around a column axes and we can use start.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.709
end here to move those grid boxes around but most
of the time we want this field and we don't want to

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.790
move items around so I don't really
like using those two properties.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.170
So let's fix that to

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.449
'1fr' if I refresh.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.630
All right we have things back to normal.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.960
We're going to close this.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.869
Now the last thing I want to show you inside of this
container is my preferred method of actually creating

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.580
a grid layout in any website that I built.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.419
And what I usually like to do is something new that
we haven't seen before I usually do repeat and define

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.900
here how many rows I want.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.380
Let's say I want '3, 1fr'.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.590
So I want everything to have the same size.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.720
But there's a problem here right.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.410
Because right now this is stretching.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:27.970
But as soon as we make it too small or too big it's
just it's not extremely responsive or it's not 100

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.200
percent responsive.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:37.490
So instead I like using 'auto-fill'. And
auto-fill, just to show you what it does.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.480
If I do something like 300px and I refresh

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.490
and now I change the sizing you'll see that our
grid system or the column system adjusts auto fills

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.550
according to the size of our
viewport which is really really nice.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.260
But right now I just said 300px.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.950
So again it's not super super responsive.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.620
So instead we can use something
else called the 'minmax()'.

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.910
And I know this can look confusing.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.379
But if you remember this pattern this is the most
common pattern I would say to use when it comes to

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.430
CSS grid.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.510
So once you get used to this you can just
copy and paste it and use it everywhere.

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.800
And here we want to do is say well the minimum that
we want the size of our columns to be let's say

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.990
I want the minimum to be 200px.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.350
So that's the smallest it's
going to get the max though.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.160
How big do we want these to get.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.720
And this is a common thing.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.360
What do we want as the biggest.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:55.169
Well just '1fr'. Because as we'll see by doing
this they'll will automatically adjust to the

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.639
size of the viewport.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.100
Let me just save and show you what I mean.
If I refresh here.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.570
I see I have three here.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:11.379
It auto adjusts auto adjusts based on our size but you
also see that the container itself is also adjusting

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.340
in size so that if I go
smaller and smaller and smaller

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:26.000
as soon as we hit the to
200px minimum it adjusts.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:36.450
And because we said '1fr' is the max as soon as the
viewport is really very small and goes below 200px

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:43.690
it's going to just take up one fraction and
in our case it will be the entire screen.

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:54.050
So using this syntax of 'repeat(auto-fill, minmax())'
giving it a minimum we're able to make this completely

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.639
responsive.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.630
And as you can see here
it's pretty powerful right.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.300
In just a few lines of code we've made this
grid system that is completely responsive.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:13.920
All right up to this point we've just focused on
the container but what about the individual items.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.419
What if we want something that's maybe bigger than the
other item and we don't want them all symmetrical

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.709
like this.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:22.710
What will we do?

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.550
Let's find out in the next video.
