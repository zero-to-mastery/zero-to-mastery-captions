00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:10.090
Welcome back. Now up to this point we learned about
HTML, CSS, templates and learned how to do layout

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.429
with things like flexbox and CSS grid and probably
the most important thing that you need to know

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:23.239
from these sections is how to create a website right
how to layout a website but also not spend a lot

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.859
of time on simple tasks because when we get to the
JavaScript section which is the more exciting actual

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.120
logic programming part of the course
that's when you truly become a developer.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.390
Up until now with what we've learned is the foundation
that that allows us to build web apps and applications

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.820
but you're never going to actually get
interviewed about these specific topics.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:55.390
I mean yes in small cases you might be if you're a
designer you might get asked questions about CSS

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.040
and HTML.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.109
But most of the time the questions you'll be asked
is on things like JavaScript logic and more complex

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.490
topics that we're going to
cover later on in the course.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.320
But the one thing that I really want to take away
from this section is being able to build websites

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.709
fast or at least get to the part where you need to
start writing javascript because that's where your

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.239
real job begins.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.729
So I have a task for you using all
the skills that you've learned.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.999
Up until now I wanted to do create a layout of a
website something that you're going to do over and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.400
over throughout your career.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.330
And I've created a small starter file here where we
have these little button like containers or divs.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.449
But as the name suggests I want you to align these
in a responsive way to something that looks like

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.100
this.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.269
I know it's not the prettiest thing right now to
look at and we're only focusing on layout but what

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.720
I want you to do is to make the header
green button over here be an actual header.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.389
We want the cover to be well the actual cover of our
site and then maybe have a project grid where we

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.779
list all of our projects like we have over here and
then obviously a footer at the bottom and I've selected

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.159
this layout because it's a very common pattern that
you'll see in a lot of websites so you're going

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.330
to be doing this a lot.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:33.370
So let's figure out the best way to go about doing this
so that when I make this smaller it's all responsive.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.959
So your task is to use whatever you've learned up
until now to create this using the starter files and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.829
don't worry I'll have a solution
video for you after this.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.109
And we'll also go into how easy it is once you have
a layout which is the recommended way to build a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.809
website starting with the layout first and then
once you have the layout fixed converting this into

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.590
something usable like this because styling becomes
really really easy once you have the layout in place.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.590
Now the one hint that I want to give here is to use
both flexbox and CSS grid to accomplish your goal

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.000
although anything you can do in flexbox.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:24.490
You can do with grid and vice versa or at least
most things using the tools in combination flexbox

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.220
and CSS grid together is really really powerful
to allow you to build a layout like this.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.080
So good luck.

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:36.420
I know it's going to be tough but
I'll see you in the solution video.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.750
Bye bye.
