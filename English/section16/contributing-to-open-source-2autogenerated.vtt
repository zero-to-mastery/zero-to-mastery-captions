WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.590
Welcome back.

00:02.590 --> 00:07.030
We've just done our first contribution which wasn't that crazy right.

00:07.030 --> 00:13.970
We just went to the start here guideline and added our names to the contributors list but let's actually

00:13.970 --> 00:17.020
contribute to an open source project now.

00:17.060 --> 00:22.710
Now in our community every month we do coding challenges.

00:22.750 --> 00:30.280
Now you can search for coding challenges here but this month is a special event because we're actually

00:30.280 --> 00:37.460
doing a half Tobar fest event and this happens once a year in our community.

00:37.460 --> 00:46.120
In October and you can see that if we click on the hack Tobar fest 2019 link so depending on when you

00:46.120 --> 00:49.830
watch this you might have a different ear.

00:49.970 --> 00:56.080
You see that we've provided for you an opportunity to contribute to an open source project.

00:56.120 --> 00:59.300
We actually have animation nation.

00:59.390 --> 01:11.840
We have a Santa fied project and also a Python project and you can contribute to any one of these so

01:11.900 --> 01:19.810
if we look at animation nation while people have contributed their CSF animations here.

01:20.090 --> 01:22.290
This one looks nice.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.820
We also have the Santa fied project.

01:24.910 --> 01:33.170
So people have created a little Santa Web site that's kind of nice very very cool.

01:33.530 --> 01:40.160
And then we also have the python art project that actually does something really cool.

01:40.280 --> 01:49.900
If I go to the Web site here it will actually turn an image into ASCII art which is really really cool.

01:49.900 --> 01:59.050
Now there's tons of projects that you can do but let's try and do this animation nation project so the

01:59.050 --> 02:03.040
first thing I'm going to do is go to the project repository

02:06.480 --> 02:11.880
and follow the steps that we've done before that is we fork the repository

02:14.710 --> 02:18.510
we now clone this repository.

02:18.810 --> 02:22.050
Let's get clone.

02:22.260 --> 02:25.350
And while that is being cloned let's look at the instructions

02:28.300 --> 02:28.840
now.

02:28.870 --> 02:35.510
Most open source projects will have instructions on how you can contribute in our case.

02:35.580 --> 02:38.270
We have a nice step by step guide.

02:38.490 --> 02:43.200
So in the our directory create a directory name after yourself.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.500
Ok that's nice and easy to do.

02:45.870 --> 02:57.520
So let's C.D. into the animation nation project let's open it up and sublime and we see that there's

02:57.570 --> 03:06.760
an art folder and in here we have to create our own name or our own folder with our name I've actually

03:06.760 --> 03:18.960
already created a folder called animatronic that has a little CSR project with an X dot HMO and CSX.

03:19.150 --> 03:25.810
So just to show you let's move this or just to show you.

03:26.020 --> 03:31.680
This is my little animation using some simple index a sheet metal and CSX.

03:31.780 --> 03:33.220
Nothing too crazy.

03:33.370 --> 03:38.860
Now all we need to do is move this into the art folder as the instructions have given us

03:41.650 --> 03:45.600
and now we've added our project.

03:45.610 --> 03:48.240
Let's see where is animatronic.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.000
There it is.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.920
That's my project over there.

03:51.700 --> 04:00.280
Next is to well within this folder make sure we create two files an HMO file and a CSX file and link

04:00.280 --> 04:05.820
the CSX file to your HMO using only H2 Mellon CSX.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.270
Create a work of art.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.460
So I've actually already done that again.

04:10.480 --> 04:16.630
If we go back to the project I have an index a sheet metal file very very simple that's linked to a

04:16.630 --> 04:22.090
style sheet and this is my styles that I've added for my animation that

04:25.540 --> 04:27.200
these little lines now.

04:27.280 --> 04:33.220
The last part here is to add my own card to this section to include dodgy JSF.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.950
So let's just copy this

04:39.730 --> 04:40.690
go to the

04:43.320 --> 04:45.620
includes or include Dodge.

04:45.620 --> 04:49.230
Yes and you see this is where everybody enters their information.

04:50.970 --> 04:56.220
And right here we can just add while we copy and pasted.

04:56.390 --> 04:59.400
Make sure the indentation is proper.

04:59.540 --> 05:03.370
So the our name is going to be called animatronic

05:05.900 --> 05:08.870
page link is going to be while the name of our folder.

05:08.900 --> 05:14.130
So I named the Tron index dot HMO

05:19.510 --> 05:24.530
and then the gift name which they suggested that we include a gift.

05:24.530 --> 05:32.860
So if I remember correctly the gift name was trance dot gift.

05:32.900 --> 05:38.000
Again I just created a little gif of my animation.

05:38.540 --> 05:41.140
So we'll call it trance dot gif.

05:41.450 --> 05:49.190
Author is Andre and they get how blank is like get how blink.

05:49.260 --> 05:49.980
All right.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.410
So that should be good.

05:52.420 --> 05:56.040
Let's now make a pull request.

05:56.110 --> 06:00.020
Now notice here how I did all these changes on M..

06:00.070 --> 06:08.000
Ideally we created these changes on a new branch so we can actually just do that now get checkout be

06:10.320 --> 06:12.390
and call it animatronic

06:18.010 --> 06:23.140
so if I do get status now I see that I have two changes.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.050
That's good.

06:24.050 --> 06:28.680
Let's do get ad get commit

06:32.060 --> 06:39.460
adding my artsy ness to the project.

06:39.710 --> 06:48.210
And then finally get push origin animatronic.

06:48.220 --> 06:48.980
All right.

06:49.180 --> 06:58.730
If we go back to the project we see that we actually now have a little icon that says compare poor request

06:59.870 --> 07:10.510
if I go back to the fort repo 0 2 mastery you see right over here that I also have this yellow banner.

07:10.510 --> 07:24.270
So if I click on this and say please add me to this list and we'll link to this is Joy who's one of

07:24.270 --> 07:25.650
the managers.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.860
So I'm just going to say please add me to the list.

07:27.870 --> 07:32.190
We actually don't even need to track her because she will check this occasionally.

07:32.220 --> 07:36.520
So I'm going to create a pull request.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.940
It's now opened.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.470
That's awesome.

07:40.500 --> 07:47.010
So please add me to the list if I look at my file changes you can see that these are what I've added

07:47.100 --> 07:56.220
to the project so if I now merge pull request again you won't be able to do this but some of our management

07:56.220 --> 08:01.260
team people who are managing the open source projects will be able to merge for you

08:05.560 --> 08:10.540
We can delete the branch since we have merged everything.

08:10.750 --> 08:13.410
And now let's see if the changes have been made.

08:13.480 --> 08:16.750
If I go to these 0 2 mastery animation nation.

08:16.990 --> 08:25.500
So if I now look for my project a look at that there's my little animatronic project that's well here

08:25.530 --> 08:25.820
it is.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.290
There's my CSX.

08:27.300 --> 08:28.170
That's beautiful

08:31.250 --> 08:32.930
the way this project is designed.

08:32.930 --> 08:40.340
It randomly select the CSX animation so it might not show all of them at the same time so you might

08:40.340 --> 08:42.350
have to refresh this a few times.

08:42.350 --> 08:46.760
But just like that I made my open source contribution.

08:46.760 --> 08:51.740
Now there's a ton of projects here that you can join.

08:51.740 --> 08:59.330
And like I said this is a playground for you to test make mistakes because this isn't a real workplace.

08:59.510 --> 09:05.810
We want to practice these skills before we actually go into work and make big dangerous changes.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.940
And that's open source.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.780
I highly highly recommend that you get involved.

09:10.790 --> 09:12.710
It's a great way to work with others.

09:12.710 --> 09:16.490
It's a great way to learn how get and get hub really work.

09:16.490 --> 09:21.290
There's no doubt that there's a lot that an individual programmer can do.

09:21.290 --> 09:28.610
However the progress and scale that something can be built is really compounded when many people work

09:28.700 --> 09:30.150
on something together.

09:30.290 --> 09:35.800
Go make your first open source contribution and have fun building things with your fellow programmers.

09:36.010 --> 09:39.790
And may one day lead you to impress a potential employer.

09:39.990 --> 09:41.490
See you in the next one.

09:41.730 --> 09:41.930
Bye.
