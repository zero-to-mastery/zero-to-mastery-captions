00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.170
Congratulations!

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.580
You're actually learning quite a lot.

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:08.204
Although things might still
seem a little intimidating.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.290
You now have a new found power

00:00:11.314 --> 00:00:15.074
where you can create websites
you can put them online.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.970
Now there's still lots to learn

00:00:17.994 --> 00:00:21.994
but one of the neat things about
knowing how much we know now

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.790
is that you can leverage
other people's templates.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.000
Now what does that mean?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.230
It means that unlike the startup
landing page that we just created

00:00:32.254 --> 00:00:35.609
you don't have to create
everything from scratch.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.800
As a matter of fact if you
Google free HTML5 templates

00:00:39.824 --> 00:00:47.849
or free HTML CSS templates there's a ton
of free resources online that you can use.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.439
Now after this lesson I'm going to link
to some of my favorite free resources.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.410
But one of them is "mashup template".

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.830
Here you can actually use a bunch
of free templates for yourself.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.070
And if I let's say go to "Complex"
here or no let's do "factory"

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:11.134
I can actually download
the files here as HTML.

00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:13.229
And check this out!

00:01:13.344 --> 00:01:15.274
If I now open this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.450
I now have these files and there's a
lot of files that we still don't know.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.470
There's some JavaScript here
that we haven't talked about yet

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:25.794
and we'll cover these in later lessons.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.860
But the thing here is that
you know about HTML and CSS.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.739
So now if you actually
double click on this HTML

00:01:34.763 --> 00:01:39.923
you have a website that you can
use and customize to your liking

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.590
and this website is free for you to use.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.700
You can now change the background image.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.730
You can change what the button does.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.970
You can do different things

00:01:49.994 --> 00:01:53.634
and you can customize it just like
we have with a startup landing page.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:01.279
But to your own liking by just changing the
HTML and CSS files which we have right here.

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:04.550
This is the power of the web.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.029
The Web allows programmers
to share pieces of code

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:13.453
so that we don't have to constantly
reinvent things from scratch.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.500
Just like Bootstrap allowed
us to do things easily

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.889
in terms of layout, templates allow us to
create websites instead of from scratch

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.260
we get to start with a basic template.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.389
Now I want you to try building
your own startup landing page.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.080
Up until now I've shown you step by step

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:38.704
but you have the power to create
something custom to your liking.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.930
You can use something
like "mashup templates"

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:45.954
or you can elaborate on
the current startup page.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.520
You have the power to do it.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.240
And although it may seem a little bit
hard right now we're still starting off.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.380
It's good for you to get that
practice of doing things on your own.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.170
Experimenting on your own.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.869
And even if you fail even if it takes you
hours to just center a text or a button

00:03:03.893 --> 00:03:06.230
it's going to be good
practice in the long run.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.950
So give it a go.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.240
Create your own custom
startup landing page.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.800
And if you're done go share
it in our Discord server.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.140
I'll see you in the next one.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.360
Bye bye.
