00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.769
All right everybody let's keep going.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.510
What else can we do to this page
to make it look more like this one.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.770
Well I want the text uppercased here.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.429
You can see over here that
this is all in capitals.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.240
This is not. I mean I could change
this if I want to capital letters.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.980
I can also add a style

00:00:23.844 --> 00:00:25.919
to make everything uppercase.

00:00:26.734 --> 00:00:31.270
But there's also another useful
one that comes with Bootstrap.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.900
I can actually add a class

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.989
and use a class in Bootstrap
called "text-uppercase".

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:45.013
If I save this and refresh.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.950
Look at that!

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.350
Everything is uppercased.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.730
That's awesome.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.120
Now what about the button.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.290
Let's add some Bootstrap
styling to the buttons again.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.609
Let's say you don't know how to add Bootstrap
styles or you don't know the classes.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.240
We can always go to the
documentation and search buttons.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.799
There we go.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.170
We see that we have some
button classes that we can use.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.910
In our case, let's use this one.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.300
Button primary. So I'm going to
copy comeback and with this button.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.049
Let's give it a class of "btn-primary".

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:36.039
If I save and refresh. Hey look at that!
We have a Bootstrap button already.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.109
That's really really cool.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.819
But you know what I want to
have a different color right.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.840
I want the button to look more like this.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.110
Something nicer so we can
add our own custom CSS.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.800
Let's call this class

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:59.090
"btn-xl" or extra large button
and this isn't a Bootstrap class.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.410
If I save this and refresh
nothing will happen.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.960
Instead we can create this "btn-xl"
right here in our own style sheet.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.329
So let's say "btn" or ".btn-xl"

00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:19.353
is going to be let's make this
a little bit bigger is going to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:26.300
have padding of let's say
"1rem" on the sides and "2rem"

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.410
top bottom.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.860
If I refresh this.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.970
That's better.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.880
That's a lot bigger.

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:34.250
So we have an extra large button.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:38.114
Now we can add sizes or we can
add different properties here.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.079
But since we named this class "btn-xl"

00:02:42.603 --> 00:02:45.003
we should just leave it the
way it's describing things that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.089
is to make the button larger.

00:02:48.013 --> 00:02:53.313
So instead let's just modify the
existing classes that we have

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.940
which is the "btn" and "btn-primary".

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.410
So if I go back here we can
say that the "btn" class

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.190
will have a "font-weight" of let's
say "700" and a "border-radius"

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.979
that is to make the edges more circular.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.610
And we'll give it "300px".

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.950
If I save this and refresh.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.060
Mm hmm.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.870
That's a lot better.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.600
I like that.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.950
And I want this capitalized
as well and I can use the

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.119
"text-uppercase" class as we've seen before

00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:39.463
or I can just in here say
"text-transform" and just say "uppercase".

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.179
So just to use a CSS class. If I refresh.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.680
Mm hmm.

00:03:44.681 --> 00:03:46.450
That looks really really nice.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.536
Now let's keep going here.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.750
Let's add another class
here which is "btn-primary".

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.000
So we're just adding on to the
Bootstrap styles that we have

00:03:58.024 --> 00:04:00.024
and we'll just give it a "background-color"

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.899
of what should we do.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.029
Well if we go back to this page again
we inspect right here by hovering

00:04:08.153 --> 00:04:15.473
and we click we see over here as we scroll
down what color we're using over here.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
Let's see.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.200
Where is the color?

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.700
Let's see.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.580
Let's see.

00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:25.170
Oh there it is right here.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.610
So I'm going to copy the color add
it here. If I hit save and refresh.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.610
Hey look at that!

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.410
That's really really nice.

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.270
But one thing you'll notice
is that the border over here.

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:43.294
If we scroll or zoom in you see
that the border has a bit of blue.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.750
And that's default for the Bootstrap theme.

00:04:48.774 --> 00:04:52.474
So instead let's add a border as well.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:59.449
So call it "border-color"
and give it the same color.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:06.180
If I refresh that's much better although
now we're hovering and it's turning blue.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.260
That's OK but I don't like it.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.950
Let's make it hover so it's still orange
but maybe a little bit darker orange.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.130
So what can we do here?

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:17.850
Again we've seen this before.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:24.920
We can just say "btn-primary: hover"

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:29.839
and in here we can just
add "background-color"

00:05:29.863 --> 00:05:32.463
to be something a little
bit different than this.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.669
In this case we're going to
use a color that is "#ee4b08".

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.529
Don't worry I didn't memorize this.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.150
This is just something that, well

00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:47.474
I knew that I used when I
made this website first.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.900
So don't worry you never
need to memorize hex colors.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.439
Next we'll do the same
for the "border-color".

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.360
So once again we'll make the
"border-color" the same as we have here.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.190
That's great.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.029
I also want to increase
the "border-width" actually

00:06:04.053 --> 00:06:07.360
to just make it a little bit
bigger when we hover over it.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.090
So let's just give it an
extra "4px" and let's save.

00:06:11.114 --> 00:06:16.114
If I refresh and hover and look at that!

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.740
That's awesome so that's
looking really really nice.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.639
So we have the button.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.959
It's looking pretty good.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.209
We have our header.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.330
That's looking pretty great as well.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.220
The other thing I want to
add is this little line here

00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:36.244
just to give it a little
extra flair to the page

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.420
and we can use something called
an "hr" here or a horizontal line.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.330
So the "hr" tag which we
can just put in between.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.020
So let's say "hr" is a horizontal line.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.539
So if I refresh here I don't
know if you can see it.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.709
Well because it's dark.

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.490
But let's add some styling to it.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:01.049
So let's say in here that we
want the "hr"s on our page

00:07:01.073 --> 00:07:07.373
to have a "border-color"
of the orange that we've

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.230
had before which is this one over here.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:15.510
So let's say "border-color" is this.
If I save and refresh.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.940
All right.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.400
Look at that.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.069
There's our little line.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.790
It's a little thin though so
let's add a bit of sizing.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:21.030
So I'll say

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:28.970
"border-witdh" and give it let's say "3px".

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.419
And if I refresh.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.760
All right.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.590
That's getting bigger.

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:32.270
That's good.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.219
But I don't want this
to be the entire page.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.910
I only want it a little bit
just like we see it here.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.769
So we have a CSS property
here that we can use

00:07:44.793 --> 00:07:49.993
called "max-width" which as
the name suggests tells us

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.870
exactly what's the maximum
width of this thing.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:57.720
In our case let's say "65px".

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.300
So if I save this and
refresh. That's much better.

00:08:02.824 --> 00:08:07.390
All right. We're making progress
here but there is an issue right.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.370
Right now we have the content that we
want but it's all all over the place.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:13.669
It's kind of ugly isn't it.

00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:17.410
We want everything centered maybe
around this laptop over here.

00:08:17.434 --> 00:08:20.734
And this is where Bootstrap really shines.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.470
So let's figure that out in the next video.
