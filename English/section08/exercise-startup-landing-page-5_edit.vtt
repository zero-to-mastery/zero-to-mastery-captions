00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.070
All right.
It's time to talk about layout.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.509
Now we already learned how
will layout works in Bootstrap.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.040
And we talked about why
Bootstrap became so popular.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.450
Now don't worry.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.840
Later on in the course I'm going to
introduce you to topics like CSS Grid

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:22.349
and actually talk about really
easy ways to do layout on a page.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.190
But for now we want us to use Bootstrap
because that's what we learned.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.839
And I'm warning you this is
going to seem very overwhelming.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.100
I want to show you how
Bootstrap does layout because

00:00:35.124 --> 00:00:39.144
down the road when I introduce
you to things like CSS Grid

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.479
you're going to see how much easier we have
it now than we had maybe a few years ago

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.209
But I still want you to learn how layout is
done in Bootstrap because you will encounter it

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.800
throughout your career.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.279
Now if you go to the layout section
on the Bootstrap documentation

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.140
you see over here that it has
some pretty good information.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.110
We can look at the grids and we've
already talked about how grid

00:01:01.534 --> 00:01:03.334
works with Bootstrap.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.060
Now the first thing we want to do is to
have a container and then maybe some rows

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.169
that we can use columns on.

00:01:14.093 --> 00:01:18.993
So if we go back to our page and
we open up the "index.html" file.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.449
The first thing I want
to do around the body.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.919
And one thing I'll do with my Sublime Text
here is actually minimize the head tag here

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.967
just so we can see a little bit.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.190
So I'm going to just click
on this and look at that!

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.940
It's minimized so I can
just focus on the body.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.409
The first thing I want to do is
say that I want to create a "div"

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:40.133
with a class of "container".

00:01:41.157 --> 00:01:42.257
Just like that.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.320
And then we'll close this right over here.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.460
So let's indent that properly.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.470
Let's save and refresh. Allright

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.489
we have everything in a container.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.630
Next is that we want to ideally
all of these things to be in a row.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.799
So we want the "h1" the "hr" and
the "button" to just be a row

00:02:03.823 --> 00:02:08.100
one row that we have that is
in the center of the page.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.280
So I'm just going to wrap this in a "div"

00:02:12.304 --> 00:02:19.004
and give it a class of "row" so
once again let's close the "div"

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.709
and indent this again.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.085
If I refresh

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.799
not much has changed we may have lost the "hr"
we'll get back to that in a second but we

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.140
have a "row" now. So that if I inspect
let's say view developer tools

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.279
and I click on this inspect
I see, well, these elements.

00:02:46.303 --> 00:02:48.503
If I go over here and let's open this up.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.790
Make this a little bit smaller.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.100
We see that we have the "body" we have
the "div" which is the "container"

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.424
and then we have the "row" right here.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.710
All right let me close this.

00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:05.314
Let's divide up these items
into different sections.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.690
We have the "header"
element that we can use.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.569
And this header element will
contain the "h1" over here.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.189
So we have the "header" and one thing that
we can use with Bootstrap is a class called

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.670
"text-center" and "text-center"
as you might guess.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.880
If I refresh
centers the text.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.880
So that's great.

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:34.229
That's our "header" element.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.610
And we also want to create
another section here.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.130
Let's call it "section".

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.140
So this is a "section" element

00:03:42.164 --> 00:03:51.924
and this section element will
also have the class "text-center".

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.229
So if I refresh.
There you go.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.900
We got our "hr" horizontal line back.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.120
Hmm.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.330
Why isn't this center?
Let's inspect this and find out.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.039
So I can open developer tools by pressing
CMD+OPT+I

00:04:10.063 --> 00:04:12.663
or CTRL+SHIFT+I
if you're on a windows

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.230
and let's look at the elements we
have the "container" we have the "row"

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:24.710
we have the "header" and
then we have the "section".

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.250
Mm hmm.

00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:31.030
Now we see over here that these
ones aren't taking up the full width

00:04:31.054 --> 00:04:33.054
as we would want of the container.

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.320
And we've seen this before with Bootstrap.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.390
Right.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.940
We have to use this columns to tell it hey
we want to contain or expand along the call

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.830
and because Bootstrap uses a 12 grid system we can
just say in here in the header we want the column

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:02.000
12 grid and then for the section
we want the column 12 grid.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.839
So if I refresh. There you go!
Look at that!

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.639
If I go over here I see
that we have the "row"

00:05:08.663 --> 00:05:14.163
we have the "header" and then we have
the text which as you can see contains

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.540
the full amount of the container in
the blue. That's looking a lot better.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.250
That's great.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.079
Now if I close this. Hmm!
Our text and button it's still at the top.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.410
Ideally it's in the middle of the image.

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.960
How can we fix this?

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.380
Now this part is really really tricky.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.030
If I actually search
vertical alignment here

00:05:43.154 --> 00:05:47.894
you'll see that Bootstrap has
some vertical alignment options

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.300
but these ones are using inline,
inline-block, inline-table

00:05:53.224 --> 00:05:55.224
 which is actually not the recommended way.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.660
Now the way we're going to do
this is we're going to use flex.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.150
And this is a new feature with Bootstrap.

00:06:04.174 --> 00:06:10.235
Because they're using the flexbox
utilities that we've learned about.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.620
Right.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:17.399
So if I go over here you can see that
I can activate the flexbox system

00:06:17.423 --> 00:06:20.523
by using the "d-flex" class.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:28.300
So if I copy this and go to container
and say "d-flex" if I refresh.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.190
All right.

00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:33.049
Nothing happened because
we've just enabled flexbox.

00:06:35.073 --> 00:06:37.673
But now we want to make
sure that we can place

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.069
things vertically in the center

00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:49.413
and this if we scroll down is what
we want right here "align-items".

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.250
If we look over here it's
"align-items-center".

00:06:54.550 --> 00:07:03.270
So if I copy this which is this one over
here and we add "align-items-center".

00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:04.894
If I refresh.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.720
This isn't working and
this is a little tricky.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:14.760
And I'm showing you this just to
understand how to debug things.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.239
So let's say you just did
this and for some reason

00:07:18.263 --> 00:07:21.800
You don't understand why this isn't
working on the documentation page.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:28.120
Clearly it shows us that this should
be working. Well we can inspect.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:34.310
So let's right click inspect and
have a look at our HTML page.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.800
We have the container and then the body.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.230
Now you see here how
everything is in the container.

00:07:41.254 --> 00:07:42.369
And as a matter of fact

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.449
If we look at the container we're actually
aligning items in the center because

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.850
the container is actually
not the full page.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.489
It's only the top part.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.450
Right.

00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.970
It's just this part.

00:07:55.130 --> 00:08:02.850
So here the container is
not fully covering the page.

00:08:02.874 --> 00:08:04.369
So what we need to do

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:11.489
just like we have in body if we look at style
here you see how we have height of 100%.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.650
All we need to do is tell the container that
hey I want you to span the entire height

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.400
of the page and then Bootstrap

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:26.460
we can do that by saying "h-100"
instead of adding the CSS stuff.

00:08:26.484 --> 00:08:28.884
If I save this and refresh.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.310
Look at that!

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:32.650
If I hover.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:38.300
You'll see that my container is
now the full length of the page

00:08:38.324 --> 00:08:40.324
and our writing is right in the middle.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.820
If I scroll up or down look at
that it's adjusting properly.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.920
Everything is centered.
That's great!

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:53.919
Now don't worry if this takes
you a long time to figure out.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:57.169
Sometimes it involves googling
around figure things out

00:08:57.193 --> 00:09:01.893
Like it said later on in the
CSS layout section of the course

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.060
I'll actually show you how
to make this so much simpler.

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:09.470
Now the last thing I want
to do is well right here

00:09:09.494 --> 00:09:13.380
I want to have a bit of space
between the writing and the button.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.090
So what can we do here?

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.349
I want to another section
in between these two

00:09:19.373 --> 00:09:23.373
to hopefully buffer them away
from each other so we can

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.019
create that fairly easily.

00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:32.103
We can just add a new div and we'll give
it a class here of "buffer" that we'll

00:09:32.104 --> 00:09:33.819
have to write ourselves.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:41.209
In this buffer class will be in between
the header and then the horizontal line

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:42.190
and the button.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.989
So let's also give this a column of 12.

00:09:45.013 --> 00:09:49.513
Because we want to make sure
that it covers the entire area.

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.129
But right now there's nothing.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.040
If I right click here and inspect.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.219
You'll see here that I have the buffer
but the buffer doesn't have anything.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.090
It's completely empty because
well there's nothing inside here.

00:10:07.314 --> 00:10:11.014
But we can add a style let's say ".buffer".

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:17.900
In this "buffer" will have a
height of what should we say.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:25.220
Well if I do let's say "50px" and I refresh.
Look at that! I get a nice little buffer.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:32.290
So now if I scroll over to buffer you
see that I have a 50px height buffer.

00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:36.900
But I always like using "rem"
instead of "px"s so let's do "rem".

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.929
Let's see what "5rem" means.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:40.160
All right.

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:41.080
That's good.

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.839
Maybe a little bit more.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.729
Let's do "10rem". Let's save and refresh.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.120
All right.

00:10:49.121 --> 00:10:50.900
That looks actually quite nice.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.310
If I close this down open it up.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:55.070
Yeah.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.680
Look at that.

00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.880
Now looks really really nice.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.040
And there we go.

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.010
We have our startup
landing page right here.

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.170
Everything looks pretty nice right.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:08.000
And the way we've organized
things seems pretty clean.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:13.279
Our button is well when
we hover available but

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:18.003
whenever I click on this
button nothing's happening.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.960
Ideally we have a new page that opens up

00:11:22.984 --> 00:11:26.964
so that we can enter or our
customers can enter their e-mails.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.560
And this is the exciting part that
we're going to get to in the next video.

00:11:30.584 --> 00:11:32.584
I'll see in that one. Bye bye.
